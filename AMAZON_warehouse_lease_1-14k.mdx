                                         or operation thereof, whether now existing or hereafter enacted, including,
                                         without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 USC 12111
                                         et seq. (the "ADA") as the same may be amended from time to time, all
                                         Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 15.1), and any covenants, conditions
                                         and restrictions encumbering the Land and/or the Project ("CC&Rs") or any
                                         supplement thereto recorded in any official or public records with respect to the
                                         Project or any portion thereof (collectively, "Applicable Laws"). Tenant shall be
                                         responsible for obtaining any permit, business license, or other permits or
                                         licenses required by any governmental agency permitting Tenant's use or
                                         occupancy of the Premises and, except as set forth in the Work Letter, for
                                         performing, at Tenant’s sole cost, all modifications or additions to the Premises
                                         in order to be in ADA compliance for its use of the Premises. Landlord warrants
                                         that the Tenant Improvements constructed by Landlord pursuant to the Work
                                         Letter will comply with ADA upon the Commencement Date. Except as
                                         specifically set forth in the preceding sentence, Landlord shall have no
                                         obligation to bring the Premises into compliance with ADA. If a change to the
                                         Premises becomes required under Applicable Laws (or if any such requirement
                                         is enforced) as a result of any Alterations (herein defined) made to the Premises
                                         by Tenant, the installation of any trade fixture in the Premises by Tenant, any
                                         particular use of the Premises by Tenant other than the Permitted Use, or any
                                         breach of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease, then Tenant, upon demand, shall
                                         (x) at Landlord’s option, either make such change at Tenant’s cost or pay
                                         Landlord the cost of making such change. In no event shall the Premises be used
                                         for any Prohibited Use (as defined in Exhibit C). Tenant and all Tenant’s Parties
                                         shall comply with the rules and regulations attached hereto as Exhibit D,
                                         together with such additional rules and regulations as Landlord may from time to
                                         time prescribe ("Rules and Regulations"). Landlord shall not knowingly
                                         discriminate against Tenant in Landlord’s enforcement of the Rules and
                                         Regulations. Landlord shall not be responsible or liable to Tenant for the non-
                                         performance of any other tenant or occupant of the Building or Project of the
                                         Rules and Regulations or for any
                                         interference or disturbance of Tenant by any other tenant or occupant. Tenant
                                         shall not commit waste, overload the floors or structure of the Building, subject
                                         the Premises, the Building, the Common Area, or the Project to any use which
                                         would damage the same or increase the risk of loss or violate any insurance
                                         coverage, permit any unreasonable odors, smoke, dust, gas, substances, noise or
                                         vibrations to emanate from the Premises or the Project, take any action which
                                         would constitute a nuisance or would disturb, obstruct or endanger any other
                                         tenants, take any action which would abrogate any warranties, use or allow the
                                         Project and/or the Premises to be used for any unlawful purpose or conduct, or
                                         permit to be conducted, any auction upon the Project and/or the Premises.

                    

                     4.        RENT. Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Base Rent, Real Property Taxes (as herein
                               defined) and Operating Expenses (as herein defined), in advance, on the first day of each
                               calendar month. All Rent and payments required to be paid by Tenant to Landlord shall
                               be made by Tenant payable to the entity and sent to the address Landlord designates and
                               shall be made by good and sufficient check payable in
                               United States of America currency or by other means acceptable to Landlord or by
                               Electronic Fund Transfer of immediately available federal funds before 11:00 a.m.
                               Eastern Time. Upon the execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the first
                               month’s Base Rent, the first monthly installment of estimated Operating Expenses. If the
                               Term commences (or ends) on a date other than the first (or last) day of a month, Base
                               Rent shall be prorated on the basis of a thirty (30) day month. All sums other than Base
                               Rent which Tenant is obligated to pay under this Lease shall be deemed to be additional
                               rent due hereunder ("Additional Rent"), whether or not such sums are designated
                               Additional Rent. The term "Rent" means the Base Rent and all Additional Rent payable
                               hereunder. The obligation of Tenant to pay Base Rent and other sums to Landlord and
                               the obligations of Landlord under this Lease are independent obligations. Tenant shall
                               have no right at any time to abate, reduce, or set-off any rent due hereunder except as
                               may be expressly provided in this Lease. If Tenant is delinquent in any monthly
                               installment of Base Rent or Additional Rent for more than five (5) days, Tenant shall pay
                               to Landlord on demand a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of such delinquent sum
                               and such delinquent sum shall also bear interest from the date such amount was due until
                               paid in full at the lesser of (i) fifteen percent (15%) per annum; or (ii) at the maximum
                               rate permitted by law ("Applicable Interest Rate"). The provision for such late charge
                               shall be in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies hereunder or at law and
                               shall not be construed as a penalty.


                     7.        TAXES. Tenant shall pay to Landlord Tenant's Proportionate Share and Tenant’s Project
                               Share of all Real Property Taxes (as herein defined) for each full or partial calendar year
                               during the Term in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 8 and Section 9
                               below. “Real Property Taxes” shall mean (a) all taxes, assessments, supplementary
                               taxes, possessory interest taxes, levies, fees, exactions or charges and other governmental
                               charges, together with any interest, charges, fees and penalties in connection therewith,
                               which are assessed, levied, charged, conferred or imposed by any public authority upon
                               the Land, the Building, the Property, the Project or any other improvements, fixtures,
                               equipment or other property located at or on the Land, the Building, the Property, or the
                               Project, all capital levies, franchise taxes, any excise, use, margin, transaction, sales or
                               privilege taxes, assessments, levies or charges and other taxes assessed or imposed on
                               Landlord upon the rents payable to Landlord under this Lease (excluding net income
                               taxes imposed on Landlord unless such net income taxes are in substitution for any Real
                               Property Taxes payable hereunder), including but not limited to, gross receipts taxes,
                               assessments for special improvement districts and building improvement districts,
                               governmental charges, fees and assessments for police, fire, traffic mitigation or other
                               governmental service of purported benefit to the Land, Building, Property, Project or
                               Premises, taxes and assessments levied in substitution or supplementation in whole or in
                               part of any such taxes and assessments and the share of the Land, Building, Property,
                               Project and Premises of any real estate taxes and assessments under any reciprocal
                               easement agreement, common area agreement or similar agreement as to the Land,
                               Building, Property, Project or Premises; (b) all personal property taxes for property that
                               is owned by Landlord and used in connection with the operation, maintenance and repair
                               of the Land, Building, Property, Project or Premises; and (c) all costs and fees incurred
                               in connection with seeking reductions in any tax liabilities described in (a) and (b),
                               including, without limitation, any costs incurred by Landlord for compliance, review and
                               appeal of tax liabilities. Prior to delinquency, Tenant shall pay all taxes and assessments,
                               together with any interest, charges, fees and penalties in connection therewith, levied
                               upon trade fixtures, alterations, additions, improvements, inventories, equipment and
                               other personal property located and/or installed on the Premises by Tenant; and, upon
                               request, Tenant shall provide Landlord copies of receipts for payment of all such taxes
                               and assessments. To the extent any such taxes are not separately assessed or billed to
                               Tenant, Tenant shall pay the amount thereof as invoiced by Landlord. Landlord may, but
                               is not obligated to, contest by appropriate legal proceedings the amount, validity, or
                               application of any Real Property Taxes or liens thereof.



                     14.       LANDLORD'S RIGHTS. Landlord reserves the right to enter the Premises upon
                               reasonable advance notice to Tenant of no less than two (2) business days (or without
                               notice in case of an emergency) and provided that Landlord shall use best efforts not nor

                               Lease: inspect the Premises and/or the performance by Tenant of the terms and
                               conditions hereof; make such alterations, repairs, improvements or additions to the
                               Premises as required or permitted hereunder; change boundary lines of the Land so long
                               as such change does not materially and adversely impact Tenant's use of the parking area
                               and/or access to the Premises; install, use, maintain, repair, alter, relocate or replace any
                               pipes, ducts, conduits, wires, equipment and other facilities in the Common Area or the
                               Building; install, maintain and operate conduit cabling within the utility and/or conduit
                               ducts and risers within the Building, as well as grant lease, license or use rights to third
                               parties, to utilize the foregoing easements or licenses on the Land, the Property and/or

                               restrictions, covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting the Land, the Property
                               and/or the Project and/or amendments to existing CC&Rs which do not unreasonably
                               interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises or impose additional material monetary
                               obligations on Tenant; change the name of the Building, the Property and/or the Project;
                               affix reasonable signs and displays on the Building and/or the Land (including rental
                               signs); and, show the Premises to prospective purchasers, current or prospective

                               of the Term (or following any Event of Default), prospective tenants. If reasonably
                               necessary, Landlord may temporarily close all or a portion of the Premises to perform
                               repairs, alterations and additions; provided, however, except in emergencies, Landlord
                               will not close the Premises if the work can reasonably be completed on weekends and
                               after
                               normal business hours. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any repair or
                               alteration to the Premises by Landlord allowed in this Section 14, Landlord will, other
                               than in an emergency, provide Tenant with thirty (30) days’ notice of such repair,
                               maintenance or alteration to allow Tenant to mitigate and reduce any operational impact
                               on its business. Entry by Landlord shall not constitute a constructive eviction or entitle
                               Tenant to an abatement or reduction of Rent, except as provided in this Lease.

                     15.       ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                                         conditions on, under, or about the Premises or the environment, including

                                         groundwater thereunder. Tenant shall neither create or suffer to exist, nor permit
                                         any Tenant Party to create or suffer to exist any lien, security interest or other
                                         charge or encumbrance of any kind with respect to the Project, including without
                                         limitation, any lien imposed pursuant to Section 107(f) of the Superfund
                                         Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. Section 9607(1)) or
                                         any similar state statute. Landlord shall have the right to enter upon and inspect
                                         the Premises and to conduct tests, monitoring and investigations. If such tests
                                         indicate the presence of any environmental condition caused or exacerbated by
                                         Tenant or any Tenant Party or arising during Tenant's or any Tenant Party's
                                         occupancy, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of conducting such
                                         tests. The phrase "environmental condition" shall mean any adverse condition
                                         relating to any Hazardous Materials or the environment, including surface water,
                                         groundwater, drinking water supply, land, surface or subsurface strata or the

                                         odors. In the event of any such environmental condition, Tenant shall promptly
                                         notify both the property manager and the Landlord and shall promptly take any
                                         and all steps necessary to rectify the
                                         same to the satisfaction of the applicable agencies and Landlord, or shall, at
                                         Landlord's election, reimburse Landlord, upon demand, for the cost to Landlord
                                         of performing work. The reimbursement shall be paid to Landlord in advance of
                                         Landlord's performing such work, based upon Landlord's reasonable estimate of
                                         the cost thereof; and upon completion of such work by Landlord, Tenant shall
                                         pay to Landlord any shortfall promptly after receipt of Landlord's bills therefor
                                         or Landlord shall promptly refund to Tenant any excess deposit, as the case may
                                         be.

                               15.2      Indemnification. Tenant shall indemnify, protect, defend (by counsel acceptable
                                         to Landlord) and hold harmless the Indemnitees from and against any and all
                                         Losses of or in connection with (1) Tenant and/or any Tenant Party's breach of
                                         this Section 15, or (2) the presence of Hazardous Materials on, under or about
                                         the Premises or other property as a result (directly or indirectly) of Tenant's
                                         and/or any Tenant Party's activities, or failure to act, in connection with the
                                         Premises. Landlord reserves the right to retain counsel for its defense, in which
                                         case Tenant shall be responsible for the cost of such defense. This indemnity
                                         shall include, without limitation, any Losses arising from or in connection with
                                         (i) the effects of any contamination or injury to person, property or the
                                         environment created or suffered by Tenant, (ii) the cost of any required or
                                         necessary repair, cleanup or detoxification, and the preparation and
                                         implementation of any closure, monitoring or other required plans, whether such
                                         action is required or necessary prior to or following the termination of this
                                         Lease, (iii) lost profits, consequential damages, the cost of demolition or
                                         rebuilding any improvements on real property, interest, penalties and damages
                                         arising from claims brought by or on behalf of employees of Tenant (with
                                         respect to which Tenant waives any right to raise as a defense against Landlord
                                         any immunity to which it may be entitled under any industrial or worker’s
                                         compensation laws), (iv) fees, costs or expenses incurred for the services of
                                         attorneys, consultants, contractors, experts, laboratories, and all other costs
                                         incurred in connection with the investigation or remediation of such Hazardous
                                         Materials or violation of such Environmental Laws, and (v) diminution in the
                                         fair market value of the Project including without limitation any reduction in fair
                                         market rental value or life expectancy of the Project or the improvements located
                                         thereon or the restriction on the use of or adverse impact on the marketing of the
                                         Project or any portion thereof. Neither the written consent by Landlord to the
                                         presence of Hazardous Materials on, under or about the Premises, nor the strict
                                         compliance by Tenant with all Environmental Laws, shall excuse Tenant from
                                         Tenant's obligation of indemnification pursuant hereto. Tenant's obligations
                                         pursuant to the foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or termination
                                         of this Lease. Neither the written consent by Landlord to the presence of
                                         Hazardous Materials on, under or about the Premises, nor the strict compliance
                                         by Tenant with all Environmental Laws, shall excuse Tenant from Tenant's
                                         obligation of indemnification pursuant hereto. Tenant's obligations pursuant to
                                         the foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.
                               15.3      Environmental Questionnaire Disclosure. Simultaneously with the execution
                                         of this Lease, Tenant shall complete, execute and deliver to Landlord a
                                         Hazardous Materials Survey Form in the form of Exhibit G attached hereto
                                         (“Survey Form”), and Tenant shall certify to Landlord that all information
                                         contained in the Survey Form is true and correct. The completed Survey Form
                                         shall be deemed incorporated into this Lease for all purposes, and Landlord shall
                                         be entitled to rely on the information contained therein. Within ten (10) days
                                         following receipt by Tenant of a written request therefor from Landlord (which
                                         request shall not be made more often than annually), Tenant shall disclose to
                                         Landlord in writing the names and amounts of all Hazardous Materials, or any
                                         combination thereof, which were stored, generated, used or disposed of on,
                                         under or about the Premises for the twelve (12) month period prior to and after
                                         each such request, or which Tenant intends to store, generate, use or dispose of
                                         on, under or about the Premises. At Landlord’s option, Tenant’s disclosure
                                         obligation under this Subparagraph shall include the requirement that Tenant
                                         update, execute and deliver to Landlord the Survey Form, as the same may be
                                         modified by Landlord from time to time.         

                
                     25.       MISCELLANEOUS.
                               25.4      Severability. If any provision of this Lease or the application of any such
                                         provision shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
                                         unenforceable to any extent, the remaining provisions of this Lease and the
                                         application thereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected,

                                         does not constitute an option to lease, offer to lease or a reservation of, or option
                                         for, the Premises; and this document shall become effective and binding only
                                         upon the execution and delivery hereof by Landlord and Tenant.

                                         benefit of the successors and assigns of Landlord and, subject to compliance
                                         with the terms of Section 19, Tenant.

                                         of the parties hereto shall be deemed or construed by the parties hereto, nor by
                                         any third party, as creating the relationship of principal and agent or of
                                         partnership or of joint venture by the parties hereto or any relationship other than

                               25.11     Merger. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant or a mutual
                                         cancellation thereof or a termination by Landlord shall not work a merger and
                                         shall, at the option of Landlord, terminate all or any existing subtenancies or
                                         may, at the option of Landlord, operate as an assignment to Landlord of any or
                                         all of such subtenancies.

                                         practice or course of dealing. No waiver by either party of any provision under
                                         this Lease shall be effective unless in writing and signed by such party. No

                                         stated. Waivers of any covenant shall not be construed as a waiver of any

                                         purchaser of the Building and/or the Project or any Mortgagee of either. Tenant

                                         signatories to the original or the same counterpart provided that all parties are

                                         of the Lease shall be deemed the equivalent of the delivery of the original, and
