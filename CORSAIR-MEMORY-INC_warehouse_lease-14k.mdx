                   THIS LEASE AGREEMENT is made and entered into by and between Landlord and Tenant on the Lease Date.
              The defined terms used in this Lease which are defined in the Basic Lease Information attached to this Lease
              Agreement (“Basic Lease Information”) shall have the meaning and definition given them in the Basic Lease
              Information. The Basic Lease Information, the exhibits, the addendum or addenda described in the Basic Lease
              Information, and this Lease Agreement are and shall be construed as a single instrument and are referred to herein as
              the “Lease.”

              1.   DEMISE
                  In consideration for the rents and all other charges and payments payable by Tenant, and for the agreements,
              terms and conditions to be performed by Tenant in this Lease, LANDLORD DOES HEREBY LEASE TO
              TENANT, AND TENANT DOES HEREBY HIRE AND TAKE FROM LANDLORD, the Premises described
              below (the “Premises”), upon the agreements, terms and conditions of this Lease for the Term hereinafter stated.

              2.   PREMISES
                   The Premises demised by this Lease consist of that certain building (the “Building”) specified in the Basic
              Lease Information, which Building is located in that certain real estate development (the “Project”) specified in the
              Basic Lease Information, together with the parcel of land on which the Building is situated. The Building has the
              address and contains the square footage specified in the Basic Lease Information; provided, however, that any
              statement of square footage set forth in this Lease, or that may have been used in calculating any of the economic
              terms hereof, is an approximation which Landlord and Tenant agree is reasonable and, no economic terms based
              thereon shall be subject to revision whether or not the actual square footage is more or less. The location of the
              Building is depicted on Exhibit A, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. The Premises
              include the parking area (“Parking Area”) adjacent to the Building as shown on Exhibit A. Tenant shall have the
              non-exclusive right to use the Common Areas (as hereinafter defined). For purposes of this Lease, the term
              “Common Areas” shall mean all areas and facilities, if any, outside the Premises and within the exterior boundary
              line of the Project that are, from time to time, provided and designated by Landlord for the non-exclusive use of
              Landlord, Tenant and other tenants of the Project and their respective employees, guests and invitees.

                   The Premises shall be leased by Tenant in “as-is” condition without any improvements or alterations by
              Landlord, except to the extent Landlord has expressly agreed to make such improvements or alterations in the
              Tenant Improvement Work Letter attached hereto as Exhibit B. Landlord and Tenant agree to and shall be bound by
              the terms and conditions of Exhibit B.

                   Provided Landlord does not materially, adversely affect Tenant’s use of the Premises, the Building or the
              Parking Area, or unreasonably interfere with Tenant’s use and quiet enjoyment of the Premises, Landlord has the
              right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to: (a) make reasonable changes to the Building, the Premises and/or
              the Project, including, without
              limitation, changes in the exact configuration and/or location of ingress and egress; (b) close temporarily facilities or
              areas for maintenance purposes so long as reasonable access to the Building and Parking Area remains available;
              (c) use the Parking Area while engaged in making additional improvements, repairs or alterations to the Project or
              any portion thereof; and (d) do and perform any other acts that alter or expand or make any other changes in, to or
              with respect to the Building, the Premises and/or the Project as Landlord may, in its sole discretion, deem to be
              appropriate.

                   Without limiting the foregoing, Landlord reserves the right from time to time to install, use, maintain, repair,
              relocate and replace pipes, ducts, conduits, wires, and appurtenant meters and equipment for service to the Premises
              which are above the ceiling surfaces, below the floor surfaces, within the walls and in the central core areas of the
              Building. In connection with any of the foregoing activities of Landlord, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts while
              conducting such activities to minimize any interference with Tenant’s use of the Premises.

                   No rights to any view or to light or air over any property, whether belonging to Landlord or any other person,
              are granted to Tenant by this Lease. If at any time any windows of the Building are reasonably temporarily darkened
              or the light or view therefrom is obstructed by reason of any repairs, improvements, maintenance or cleaning in or
              about the Building, the same shall be without liability to Landlord and without any reduction or diminution of
              Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.

              3.   TERM
                   The term of this Lease (the “Term”) shall be for the period of months and days specified in the Basic Lease
              Information, commencing on the earlier to occur of the following dates (the “Commencement Date”):
                   (a) June 1, 2005; or
                   (b) The date Tenant commences business operations in any portion of the Premises.

                  In the event the actual Commencement Date, as determined pursuant to the foregoing, is a date other than the
              Estimated Commencement Date, then Landlord and Tenant shall promptly execute a Commencement and Expiration
              Date Memorandum in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, wherein the parties shall specify the Commencement
              Date, the date on which the Term expires (the “Expiration Date”) and the date on which Tenant is to commence
              paying Rent (as defined below).

              4.   RENT
                   (a) Base Rent. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, in advance on the first day of each month, without further notice
              or demand and without abatement, offset, rebate, credit or deduction for any reason whatsoever, the monthly
              installments of rent specified in the Basic Lease Information (the “Base Rent”).

                 Upon execution of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Security Deposit, Prepaid Rent and the first
              monthly installment of estimated Additional Rent (as hereinafter defined)
              specified in the Basic Lease Information to be applied toward Base Rent and Additional Rent for the month(s) of the
              Term specified in the Basic Lease Information.

                   As used in this Lease, the term “Additional Rent” shall mean all sums of money, other than Base Rent, that
              shall become due from and payable by Tenant pursuant to this Lease.

                   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant’s obligation to pay Base Rent for the first four (4) months of the Term
              shall be waived, provided that and only so long as Tenant fully performs all of its monetary obligations under this
              Lease. Tenant understands and agrees that, if any time during the Term, Tenant fails to cure any monetary default
              within the time period set forth in Paragraph 24 below, Landlord’s agreement to waive payment of Base Rent shall
              be immediately revoked without further notice to Tenant, and any previous waiver of Base Rent shall be null and
              void. In any notice given by Landlord pursuant to Paragraph 24 of this Lease, Landlord shall have the right to
              demand any and all Base Rent that would have been due and payable in accordance with this Lease absent the
              waiver contained herein. Landlord’s waiver of Tenant’s obligation to pay Base Rent during the first four (4) months
              of the Term shall not be construed as Landlord’s waiver of Tenant’s obligation to pay Additional Rent during such
              four month period (including, without limitation, Operating Expenses, Insurance Expenses, Utility Expenses, and
              Taxes).

                   (b) Additional Rent.

                       (1) This Lease is intended to be a triple-net lease with respect to Landlord and subject to the provisions of
              Paragraph 13(b) of this Lease, the Base Rent owing hereunder is (x) to be paid by Tenant absolutely net of all costs
              and expenses relating to Landlord’s ownership and operation of the Project and the Building, and (y) not to be
              reduced, offset or diminished, directly or indirectly, by any cost, charge or expense payable hereunder by Tenant or
              by others in connection with the Premises, the Building and/or the Project, or any part thereof. The provisions of this
              Paragraph 4(b) are intended to pass on to Tenant, Tenant’s share of all costs and expenses relating to Landlord’s
              ownership and operation of the Premises, the Building and/or the Project. During the Term, in addition to the Base
              Rent, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, in accordance with this Paragraph 4, (i) Tenant’s
              Proportionate Share(s) of Operating Expenses (as defined below) attributable to each Computation Year (as defined
              below), (ii) Tenant’s Proportionate Share(s) of Insurance Expenses (as defined below) attributable to each
              Computation Year, (iii) Tenant’s Proportionate Share(s) of Utility Expenses (as defined below) attributable to each
              Computation Year, and (iv) Tenant’s Proportionate Share(s) of Taxes (as defined below) attributable to each
              Computation Year.

                   (a) Tenant shall pay the cost of all water, sewer use, sewer discharge fees and permit costs and sewer connection
              fees, gas, heat, electricity, refuse pickup, janitorial service, telephone and all materials and services or other utilities
              of any kind or nature (collectively, “Utilities”) billed or metered separately to the Premises and/or Tenant, together
              with all taxes, assessments, charges and penalties added to or included within such cost. Tenant acknowledges that
              the Premises, the Building and/or the Project may become subject to the rationing of Utility services or restrictions
              on Utility use as required by a utility company, governmental agency or other similar entity having jurisdiction
              thereof. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that its tenancy, and occupancy hereunder shall be subject to such
              rationing or restrictions as may be imposed upon Landlord, Tenant, the Premises, the Building and/or the Project,
              and Tenant shall in no event be excused or relieved from any covenant or obligation to be kept or performed by
              Tenant by reason of any such rationing or restrictions. Tenant agrees to comply with energy conservation programs
              implemented by Landlord by reason of rationing, restrictions or Laws.
                   (b) Landlord shall not be liable for any loss, injury or damage to property caused by or resulting from any
              variation, interruption, or failure of Utilities due to any cause whatsoever, or from failure to make any repairs or
              perform any maintenance No temporary interruption or failure of such services incident to the making of repairs,
              alterations, improvements, or due to accident, strike, or conditions or other events shall be deemed an eviction of
              Tenant or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations hereunder. In no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any
              damage to the Premises or for any loss, damage or injury to any property therein or thereon occasioned by bursting,
              rupture, leakage or overflow of any plumbing or other pipes (including, without limitation, water, steam, and/or
              refrigerant lines), sprinklers, tanks, drains, drinking fountains or washstands, or other similar cause in, above, upon
              or about the Premises, the Building, or the Project.

              8.   POSSESSION
                   (a) Tenant’s Right of Possession. Subject to Paragraph 8(b), Tenant shall be entitled to possession of the
              Premises upon commencement of the Term. In addition, Tenant shall have the right to enter the Premises prior to
              commencement of the Term as set forth in Exhibit B. Tenant’s entry into and possession of the Premises (or portions
              thereof) prior to the Commencement Date shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Lease, except for
              the obligation to pay Rent.

                   (b) Delay in Delivering Possession. If for any reason whatsoever, Landlord cannot deliver possession of the
              Premises to Tenant on or before the Estimated Commencement Date, this Lease shall not be void or voidable, nor
              shall Landlord, or Landlord’s agents, advisors, employees, partners, shareholders, directors, invitees, independent
              contractors or Landlord’s Investment Advisors (as hereinafter defined) (collectively, “Landlord’s Agents”), be
              liable to Tenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom. Tenant shall not be liable for Rent until Landlord
              delivers possession of the Premises to Tenant. The Expiration Date shall be extended by the same number of days
              that Tenant’s possession of the Premises was delayed beyond the Estimated Commencement Date.

              9.   USE OF PREMISES
                   (a) Permitted Use. The use of the Premises by Tenant and Tenant’s agents, advisors, employees, partners,
              shareholders, directors, customers, invitees and independent contractors (collectively, “Tenant’s Agents”) shall be
              solely for the Permitted Use specified in the Basic
              Lease Information and for no other use. Tenant shall not permit any objectionable or unpleasant odor, smoke, dust,
              gas, noise or vibration to emanate from or near the Premises. The Premises shall not be used to create any nuisance
              or trespass, for any illegal purpose, for any purpose not permitted by Laws (as herein defined), for any purpose that
              would invalidate the insurance or increase the premiums for insurance on the Premises, the Building or the Project
              or for any purpose or in any manner that would interfere with other tenants’ use or occupancy of the Project. If any
              of Tenant’s office machines or equipment disturb any other tenant in the Building, then Tenant shall provide
              adequate insulation or take such other action as may be necessary to eliminate the noise or disturbance. Tenant
              agrees to pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, any increases in premiums on policies resulting from Tenant’s
              Permitted Use or any other use or action by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents which increases Landlord’s premiums or
              requires additional coverage by Landlord to insure the Premises. Tenant agrees not to overload the floor(s) of the
              Building.


              10. ACCEPTANCE OF PREMISES
                   By its execution hereof, Tenant acknowledges that it had the opportunity to fully inspect the Premises. Tenant
              accepts the Premises as suitable for Tenant’s intended use and as being in good and sanitary operating order,
              condition and repair, AS IS, and without representation or warranty by Landlord as to the condition, use or
              occupancy which may be made thereof Any exceptions to the foregoing must be in the Tenant Improvement Work
              Letter attached as Exhibit B hereto, or by separate written agreement executed by Landlord and Tenant.



              13. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS OF PREMISES
                   (a) Maintenance by Tenant. Throughout the Term, Tenant shall, at its sole expense, (1) keep and maintain in
              good order and condition the Building, and repair and replace every part thereof, including glass, windows, window
              frames, window casements, skylights, interior and exterior doors, door frames and door closers; interior lighting
              (including, without limitation, light bulbs and ballasts), the portions of the plumbing and electrical systems located
              in or exclusively serving the Premises, all communications systems serving the Building, Tenant’s signage, interior
              demising walls and partitions, equipment, interior painting and interior walls and floors, and the roll-up doors, ramps
              and dock equipment, including, without limitation, dock bumpers, and dock lights located in or on the Building
              (excepting only those portions of the Building or the Project to be maintained by Landlord, as provided in
              Paragraph 13(b) below), (2) furnish all expendables, including light bulbs, paper goods and soaps, used in the
              Building, and (3) keep and maintain in good order and condition, repair and replace all of Tenant’s security systems
              in or about or serving the Building and, except to the extent that Landlord notifies Tenant in writing of its intention
              to arrange for such monitoring, cause the fire alarm systems serving the Building to be monitored by a monitoring or
              protective services firm approved by Landlord in writing. Tenant shall not do nor shall Tenant allow Tenant’s Agents
              to do anything to cause any damage, deterioration or unsightliness to the Premises, the Building or the Project.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall have no responsibility to repair any damage to the Premises caused
              solely by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its employees, agents or contractors, which is not
              covered by insurance that Tenant is required to carry under this Lease or otherwise has in effect.

                   (b) Maintenance by Landlord. Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 13(a), 21 and 22, and further subject to
              Tenant’s obligation under Paragraph 4 to reimburse Landlord, in the form of Additional Rent, for Tenant’s
              Proportionate Share(s) of the cost and expense of the following items, Landlord shall repair and maintain the
              following items: the roof coverings
              (provided that Tenant installs no additional air conditioning or other equipment on the roof that damages the roof
              coverings, in which event Tenant shall pay all costs resulting from the presence of such additional equipment); the
              Parking Area and pavement, landscaping, sprinkler systems, sidewalks, driveways, curbs, and lighting systems
              adjacent to the Building. Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 13(a), 21 and 22, Landlord, at its own cost and
              expense, agrees to repair and maintain the following items: the structural portions of the roof (specifically excluding
              the roof coverings), the foundation, the footings, the floor slab, and the load bearing walls and exterior walls of the
              Building (excluding any glass and any routine maintenance, including, without limitation, any painting, sealing,
              patching and waterproofing of such walls). Notwithstanding anything in this Paragraph 13 to the contrary, Landlord
              shall have the right to either repair or to require Tenant to repair any damage to any portion of the Premises, the
              Building and/or the Project caused by or created due to any act, omission, negligence or willful misconduct of
              Tenant or Tenant’s Agents and to restore the Premises, the Building and/or the Project, as applicable, to the condition
              existing prior to the occurrence of such damage; provided, however, that in the event Landlord elects to perform
              such repair and restoration work, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for all costs and expenses incurred
              by Landlord in connection therewith. Landlord’s obligation hereunder to repair and maintain is subject to the
              condition precedent that Landlord shall have received written notice of the need for such repairs and maintenance
              and a reasonable time to perform such repair and maintenance. Tenant shall promptly report in writing to Landlord
              any defective condition known to it which Landlord is required to repair, and failure to so report such defects shall
              make Tenant responsible to Landlord for any liability incurred by Landlord by reason of such condition.

                  (c) Tenant’s Waiver of Rights. Tenant hereby expressly waives all rights to make repairs at the expense of
              Landlord or to terminate this Lease, as provided for in California Civil Code Sections 1941 and 1942, and 1932(1),
              respectively, and any similar or successor statute or law in effect or any amendment thereof during the Term.

              14. LANDLORD’S INSURANCE
                    Landlord shall purchase and keep in force fire, extended coverage and “all risk” insurance covering the
              Building and the Project. Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply with any and all reasonable requirements
              pertaining to the Premises, the Building and the Project of any insurer necessary for the maintenance of reasonable
              fire and commercial general liability insurance, covering the Building and the Project. Landlord may maintain “Loss
              of Rents” insurance, insuring that the Rent will be paid in a timely manner to Landlord for a period of at least
              twelve (12) months if the Premises, the Building or the Project or any portion thereof are destroyed or rendered
              unusable or inaccessible by any cause insured against under this Lease.

              15. TENANT’S INSURANCE
                   (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense, secure and keep in force a
              “broad form” commercial general liability insurance and property damage policy covering the Premises, insuring
              Tenant, and naming Landlord, Landlord’s investment advisors, property managers and agents from time to time,
              including, without limitation, UBS Realty Investors LLC, and Landlord’s lenders as additional insureds
              (collectively, “Landlord’s Insureds”) against any liability arising out of the ownership, use,
              occupancy or maintenance of the Premises. The minimum limit of coverage of such policy shall be in the amount of
              not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) for injury or death of one person in any one accident or
              occurrence and in the amount of not less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) for injury or death of more than
              one person in any one accident or occurrence, shall include an extended liability endorsement providing contractual
              liability coverage (which shall include coverage for Tenant’s indemnification obligations in this Lease), and shall
              contain a severability of interest clause or a cross liability endorsement. Such insurance shall further insure Landlord
              and Tenant against liability for property damage of at least Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00). Landlord may
              from time to time require reasonable increases in any such limits if Landlord believes that additional coverage is
              necessary or desirable. The limit of any insurance shall not limit the liability of Tenant hereunder. No policy
              maintained by Tenant under this Paragraph 15(a) shall contain a deductible greater than five thousand dollars
              ($5,000.00). No policy shall be cancelable or subject to reduction of coverage without thirty (30) days prior written
              notice to Landlord (except in the event of cancellation as a result of nonpayment, in which case the insurer shall give
              Landlord at least ten (10) days prior written notice). Such policies of insurance shall be issued as primary policies
              and not contributing with or in excess of coverage that Landlord may carry, by an insurance company authorized to
              do business in the state/commonwealth in which the Premises are located for the issuance of such type of insurance
              coverage and rated B+:XIII or better in Best’s Key Rating Guide. The amount of liability coverage required
              hereunder may be achieved by Tenant’s obtaining excess liability or “umbrella” policies to supplement its primary
              policy.



              16. INDEMNIFICATION
                   (a) Of Landlord. Tenant shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless Landlord and Landlord’s Agents
              against and from any and all claims, suits, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, causes of action and expenses
              (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements) arising from (1) the use of the
              Premises, the Building or the Project by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, or from any activity done, permitted or suffered
              by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents in or about the Premises, the Building or the Project, and (2) any act, neglect, fault,
              willful misconduct or omission of Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, or from any breach or default in the terms of this
              Lease by Tenant or Tenant’s Agents, and (3) any action or proceeding brought on account of any matter in items
              (1) or (2). If any action or proceeding is brought against Landlord by reason of any such claim, upon notice from
              Landlord, Tenant shall defend the same at Tenant’s expense by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord. As a
              material part of the consideration to Landlord, Tenant hereby releases Landlord and Landlord’s Agents from
              responsibility for, waives its entire claim of recovery for and assumes all risk of (i) damage to property or injury to
              persons in or about the Premises, the Building or the Project from any cause whatsoever (except to the extent is
              caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlord’s Agents or by the failure of Landlord
              to observe any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, if such failure has persisted for an unreasonable period of
              time after written notice of such failure), or (ii) loss resulting from business interruption or loss of income at the
              Premises. The obligations of Tenant under this Paragraph 16 shall survive any termination of this Lease.

                   (b) No Impairment of Insurance. The foregoing indemnity shall not relieve any insurance carrier of its
              obligations under any policies required to be carried by either party pursuant to this Lease, to the extent that such
              policies cover the peril or occurrence that results in the claim that is subject to the foregoing indemnity.



              25. LANDLORD’S REMEDIES
                   (a) Termination. In the event of any Default by Tenant, then in addition to any other remedies available to
              Landlord at law or in equity and under this Lease, Landlord shall have the immediate option to terminate this Lease
              and all rights of Tenant hereunder by giving written notice to Tenant of such intention to terminate. If Landlord shall
              elect to so terminate this Lease then Landlord may recover from Tenant:

                       (1) the worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent and any other sums due and payable which have
              been earned at the time of such termination; plus

                       (2) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent and any other sums due and
              payable which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental
              loss Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus

                       (3) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent and any other sums due and
              payable for the balance of the term of this Lease after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
              Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; plus

                        (4) any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by
              Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course would be likely to result
              therefrom, including, without limitation, (A) any costs or expenses incurred by Landlord (1) in retaking possession
              of the Premises; (2) in maintaining, repairing, preserving, restoring, replacing, cleaning, altering, remodeling or
              rehabilitating the Premises or any affected portions of the Building or the Project, including such actions undertaken
              in connection with the reletting or attempted reletting of the Premises to a new tenant or tenants; (3) for leasing
              commissions, advertising costs and other expenses of reletting the Premises; or (4) in carrying the Premises,
              including taxes, insurance premiums, utilities and security precautions; (B) any unearned brokerage commissions
              paid in connection with this Lease; (C) reimbursement of any previously waived or abated Base Rent or Additional
              Rent or any free rent or reduced rental rate granted hereunder; and (D) any concession made or paid by Landlord for
              the benefit of Tenant including, but not limited to, any moving allowances, contributions, payments or loans by
              Landlord for tenant improvements or build-out allowances (including without limitation, any unamortized portion of
              the Tenant Improvement Allowance, such Tenant Improvement Allowance to be amortized over the Term in the
              manner reasonably determined by Landlord), if any, and any outstanding balance (principal and accrued interest) of
              the Tenant Improvement Loan, if any), or assumptions by Landlord of any of Tenant’s previous lease obligations;
              plus

                        (5) such reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by Landlord as a result of a Default, and costs in the event suit
              is filed by Landlord to enforce such remedy; and plus

                      (6) at Landlord’s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted
              from time to time by applicable law.

  
              26. LANDLORD’S RIGHT TO PERFORM TENANT’S OBLIGATIONS
                   (a) Without limiting the rights and remedies of Landlord contained in Paragraph 25 above, if Tenant shall be in
              Default in the performance of any of the terms, provisions, covenants or conditions to be performed or complied
              with by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, then Landlord may at Landlord’s option, without any obligation to do so, and
              without notice to Tenant perform any such term, provision, covenant, or condition, or make any such payment and
              Landlord by reason of so doing shall not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage thereby sustained by Tenant
              or anyone holding under or through Tenant or any of Tenant’s Agents.

                  (b) Without limiting the rights of Landlord under Paragraph 26(a) above, Landlord shall have the right at
              Landlord’s option, without any obligation to do so, to perform any of Tenant’s covenants or obligations under this
              Lease without notice to Tenant in the case of an
              emergency, as determined by Landlord in its sole and absolute judgment, or if Landlord otherwise determines in its
              sole discretion that such performance is necessary or desirable for the proper management and operation of the
              Building or the Project or for the preservation of the rights and interests or safety of other tenants of the Building or
              the Project.

                   (c) If Landlord performs any of Tenant’s obligations hereunder in accordance with this Paragraph 26, the full
              amount of the cost and expense incurred or the payment so made or the amount of the loss so sustained shall
              immediately be owing by Tenant to Landlord, and Tenant shall promptly pay to Landlord upon demand, as
              Additional Rent, the full amount thereof with interest thereon from the date of payment by Landlord at the lower of
              (1) ten percent (10%) per annum, or (2) the highest rate permitted by applicable law.


              28. TAXES
                   Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay, prior to delinquency, all taxes levied against Tenant’s Property. If any
              Alteration installed by Tenant or any of Tenant’s Property pursuant to Paragraph 12 is assessed and taxed with the
              Project or Building, Tenant shall pay such taxes to Landlord within ten (10) days after delivery to Tenant of a
              statement therefor.

              29. EFFECT OF CONVEYANCE
                   The term “Landlord” as used in this Lease means, from time to time, the then current owner of the Building or
              the Project containing the Premises, so that, in the event of any sale of the Building or the Project, Landlord shall be
              and hereby is entirely freed and relieved of all covenants and obligations of Landlord hereunder, and it shall be
              deemed and construed, without further agreement between the parties and the purchaser at any such sale, that the
              purchaser of the Building or the Project has assumed and agreed to carry out any and all covenants and obligations
              of Landlord hereunder.

              30. TENANT’S ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE
                    From time to time, upon written request of Landlord, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to
              Landlord or its designee an Estoppel Certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E and with any
              other statements reasonably requested by Landlord or its designee. Any such Estoppel Certificate may be relied
              upon by a prospective purchaser of Landlord’s interest or a mortgagee of (or holder of a deed of trust encumbering)
              Landlord’s interest or assignee of any mortgage or deed of trust upon Landlord’s interest in the Premises. If Tenant
              fails to provide such certificate within ten (10) business days of receipt by Tenant of a written request by Landlord
              as herein provided, such failure shall, at Landlord’s election, constitute a Default under this Lease, and Tenant shall
              be deemed to have given such certificate as above provided without modification and shall be deemed to have
              admitted the accuracy of any information supplied by Landlord to a prospective purchaser or mortgagee or deed of
              trust holder.



              32. ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANTS
                   (a) Prior to executing this Lease, Tenant has completed, executed and delivered to Landlord a Hazardous
              Materials Disclosure Certificate (“Initial Disclosure Certificate”), a fully completed copy of which is attached

              Materials which will be manufactured, treated, used or stored on or about the Premises by Tenant or Tenant’s
              Agents. Tenant shall, upon request by Landlord not more frequently than annually, and at such other times as Tenant

              of Hazardous Materials on or about the Premises, which Updated Disclosure Certificates shall be in the same format

              shall deliver an Updated Disclosure Certificate to Landlord not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date Tenant
              intends to commence the manufacture, treatment, use or storage of new or additional Hazardous Materials on or
              about the Premises, and Landlord shall have the right to approve or disapprove such new or additional Hazardous
              Materials in its sole and absolute discretion. Tenant shall make no use of Hazardous Materials on or about the
              Premises except as described in the Initial Disclosure Certificate or as otherwise approved by Landlord in writing in
              accordance with this Paragraph 32(a).

              (i) requires reporting, investigation or remediation under any Environmental Laws (as hereinafter defined),
              (ii) causes or threatens to cause a nuisance on the Premises or any adjacent area or property or poses or threatens to
              pose a hazard to the health or safety of persons on the Premises or any adjacent area or property, or (iii) which, if it

              39. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                   In the event of any default or breach by Landlord under this Lease or arising in connection herewith or with
              Landlord’s operation, management, leasing, repair, renovation, alteration or any other matter relating to the Project
              or the Premises Tenant’s remedies shall be limited solely and exclusively to an amount which is equal to the lesser
              of (a) the interest in the Building of the then-current Landlord or (b) the equity interest Landlord would have in the
              Building if the Building were encumbered by third party debt in an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the
              value of the Building (as such value is reasonably determined by Landlord) provided that in no event shall such
              liability extend to any sales or insurance proceeds received by Landlord or the “Landlord Parties” in connection with
              the Project, Building or Premises. For purposes of this Lease, “Landlord Parties” shall mean, collectively,
              Landlord, its partners, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, investment advisors, or any successor in interest
              of any of them. Neither Landlord, nor any of the Landlord Parties shall have any personal liability therefor, and
              Tenant hereby expressly waives and releases such personal liability on behalf of itself and all persons claiming by,
              through or under Tenant. The limitations of liability contained in this Paragraph 39 shall inure to the benefit of
              Landlord’s and the Landlord Parties’ present and future partners, beneficiaries, officers, directors, trustees,
              shareholders, agents and employees, and their respective partners, heirs, successors and assigns. Under no
              circumstances shall any present or future partner of Landlord (if Landlord is a partnership), future member in
              Landlord (if Landlord is a limited liability company) or trustee or beneficiary (if Landlord or any partner or member
              of Landlord is a trust), have any liability for the performance of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease.
              Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, neither Landlord nor the Landlord Parties shall be liable under any
              circumstances for injury or damage to, or interference with Tenant’s business, including but not limited to, loss of
              profits, loss of rents or other revenues, loss of business opportunity, loss of goodwill or loss of use, in each case,
              however occurring. The provisions of this Paragraph 39 shall apply only to the Landlord, the Landlord Parties and
              the other parties herein described, and shall not be for the benefit of any insurer nor any other third party.
