2.2.Parties expressly agree that the Leased Premises can in no event be used by the Tenant for carrying out activities which could be qualified as retail trade or as an activity as a craftsman in direct contact with the public, and as a result of which the present Agreement would be governed by the Belgian law of 30 April 1951 on commercial leases.

3.2.The Tenant undertakes to use the Leased Premises as a *bonus pater familias* (i.e. normally prudent person in similar circumstances) and not to exercise any activity of which it could reasonably be expected that such activity would materially disturb the occupants of the adjacent and neighbouring parcels.

3.3.The Tenant shall furthermore use and operate the Leased Premises in compliance with all the applicable legal and regulatory requirements, such as requirements concerning fire safety and technical installations, as imposed by any advices or reports by the fire department, and the general regulations on electrical installations *("RGIE"* or *"Reglement general des installations electriques" / "AREI"* or *"Algemeen Reglement voor Elektrische Installaties").*

3.4.The Tenant undertakes to observe all the operating rules for the Leased Premises, as the Landlord may establish and communicate in advance from time to time in writing to the Tenant. Such operating rules shall be reasonable and shall always take into account the Tenant's legitimate business expectations.
