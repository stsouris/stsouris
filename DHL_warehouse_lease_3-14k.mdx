The Premises will initially contain approximately 41,252 square feet.  If Tenant elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, to cause the construction of a mezzanine as provided in Section 7.02 of this Lease, then the Premises will be increased by the size of the new mezzanine.  Regardless of whether or not Tenant exercises its option to cause the construction of a mezzanine, the Minimum Base Rent shall be as provided in the Fundamental Lease Provisions and in Section 1 of this Lease; however, if Tenant elects to add a mezzanine to the Premises, for the purposes of calculating Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the Operating Expenses as described in Section 5.01 of this Lease, the square footage of the Premises and the Building shall be increased by the square footage of the mezzanine.

2.02           Determination of Square Footage:     The square footage of the Premises, the Building, and other buildings in the Project shall be determined by measuring from the outside of exterior walls, except that such measuring shall be from the center of those walls which are shared in common by adjacent tenants.

2.03           Tenant’s Access to Premises:           Throughout the Term, Tenant will have access to all of the Premises, and all of the Common Areas of the Building, necessary for operation of the Premises twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.

(a)           Commencement Date:        The term “Commencement Date” shall mean the day that Landlord receives a Certificate of Occupancy for the Premises.  Tenant’s obligation to pay its Proportionate Share of the Operating Expenses shall commence on the Commencement Date.

(b)           Rent Commencement Date:  Tenant shall begin to pay full Minimum Base Rent on the date (the “Rent Commencement Date”) that is three (3) months after the Commencement Date.

3.02           Length of Initial Term:    The Initial Term of the Lease shall be for a period of Eighty Seven (87) consecutive full Lease Months plus any partial month which occurs as a result of the Commencement Date falling on a date that is any date other than the first day of the month.

Landlord, Landlord’s mortgage lenders and any purchasers of all or a portion of the building and Tenant and any lender, assignee or subtenant of Tenant shall be entitled to rely upon such certificate.

If Tenant fails to timely exercise the option to extend as described above, this Lease shall expire on the last day of the Initial Term.  The option term shall be governed by the same terms, covenants and conditions as the original Lease with the exception of the length of term as referenced above, and the rent.

The Minimum Base Rent during the Extension Term shall be negotiated at the time option is exercised and shall reflect the market price for spaces of the same size and with a similar location and utility.

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

Tenant can only terminate the Lease and exit the Premises by providing Landlord at least six months’ written notice.

Minimum Base Rent is due in advance on the first day of each calendar month during the Term.  Minimum Base Rent for any partial month shall be prorated on a per-diem basis.  If the Rent Commencement Date is a day other than the first day of a calendar month, then upon the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant will pay to Landlord, as Minimum Base Rent for the partial month, a pro rata portion of Minimum Base Rent payable for a full month, based on the number of days in the month from Rent Commencement Date to the end of the month.

4.02           Late Penalty:     Minimum Base Rent and any additional Rent is due on the 1st of each month.  Any payment of Rent received after the 7th business day of each month shall incur a late penalty of 5% of the overdue amount plus interest on the unpaid balance of 12% per annum.  Tenant shall have 10 business days from receipt of invoice to pay any other “Non Rent” related invoices.

1. `NET LEASE: OPERATING EXPENSES`

5.01           Additional Occupancy Costs:     It is the intent of both parties that except as otherwise provided in this Lease, the Minimum Base Rent shall be absolutely net to Landlord throughout the Term and, that all costs, expenses and obligations of every kind relating to the Premises which may arise or become due during the Term  shall be paid by Tenant, but excluding any costs, expenses, and obligations which are Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, or which arise from Landlord’s negligence, intentional acts of omissions by Landlord, its agents, employees or contractors, or Landlord’s breach of its obligations under this Lease.  Commencing on the Commencement Date and continuing monthly thereafter during the remainder of the Term, Tenant shall pay as additional rent, without demand thereof and without offset or deduction, (together with each payment of Minimum Base Rent) an amount equal to Tenant’s Proportionate Share, (defined below) of expenses and charges as set forth in Section 5.02 through Section 5.04 (“Operating Expenses”).  Tenant’s  “Proportionate Share” of the Operating Expenses shall be determined by multiplying the Operating Expense in question by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total square footage of the Premises, and the denominator of which shall be the total square footage  of the Building.

5.02           Taxes:

```
          (a)   Commencing on the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay monthly its Proportionate Share of all Real Estate Taxes (defined later) levied or assessed by lawful taxing authorities against the Land

```

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

serving the Building (the “Land”), the Building and all improvements attached to the Land.  The amount

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

of Real Estate Taxes upon which such payment is based shall be estimated from the most current notice(s) of assessment or tax xxxx(s) concerning the entire Building or, if there are none, such amount as Landlord may reasonably determine.  A tax xxxx submitted by Landlord to Tenant shall be conclusive evidence of the amount of taxes assessed or levied, as well as the items taxed.  Landlord represents that the Land is or will be a separate parcel for ad valorem tax purposes.

(b)   As used herein “Real Estate Taxes”: shall mean all real estate or rental taxes, assessments, levies, charges, surcharges, water and sewer fees (not based on consumption), standby fees, the cost of protesting any of the foregoing and any other governmental charges or impositions, whether general or special, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, which may be levied on, assessed against, or charged with respect to the ownership of, or other equivalent interest in: (i) the Land serving the Building; (ii) the Building and other improvements situated on the Land serving the Building; and (iii) any other levies in lieu of the foregoing or any assessments thereof for public improvements which are deemed to benefit such Land serving the Building.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Real Estate Taxes” shall not include any income tax, capital levy, estate, succession, inheritance or transfer taxes or similar tax of Landlord.

(c)   Landlord or Landlord’s agent will contest what Landlord deems to be unreasonable tax, assessments, impositions and charges of every kind and nature by any governmental authority on the Building or the Land or otherwise provide Tenant the right of contest in the name of Landlord as provided below.  If, as a result of any contest, application or proceeding brought by or on behalf of Landlord for reduction in any taxes or the assessed valuation of the Premises affecting any tax year occurring during the Term, there shall be a decrease in Real Estate Taxes for any such year, Landlord’s next statement following such decrease shall include an adjustment for such tax year reflecting that tax decrease less any of Landlord’s third party expenses; if the reduction occurs after the expiration or termination of this Lease, the amount of the adjustment shall be promptly paid to Tenant.

(d)           If Landlord does not elect to contest what Tenant deems to be an unreasonable tax assessment, imposition or charge, Tenant may contest the same, in the name of Landlord; provided, however, that Landlord agrees to reasonably cooperate with Tenant in contesting such items or amounts.  Landlord shall promptly provide Tenant with the proposed notice of property valuation and tax changes so that Tenant will be able to contest the Real Estate Taxes in a timely manner.  If there shall be a decrease in property taxes, assessments, impositions or charges for any such tax year resulting from Tenant’s contest, notwithstanding the fact that the Lease Term may have expired, Tenant shall be entitled to (A) reimbursement, up to the amount of the decrease, for all reasonable costs paid by Tenant in connection with the contest, application or proceeding, and (B) to a cash payment from Landlord, or credit toward amounts owed by Tenant under this Lease, equal to Tenant’s Proportionate Share of such refund or award.  Tenant shall receive a copy of any xxxx for tax payments upon Tenant’s written request.

(e)           Tenant shall also be solely responsible for and shall pay before delinquency all municipal, county, state or federal taxes assessed during the Term, against or for leasehold improvements; lighting fixtures; equipment; interior partitions; heating and cooling; or ventilating equipment located within the Premises; or any other interior improvement of whatever kind and to whomever belonging, situated, or installed in or upon the Premises, whether or not affixed to the realty.  In the event that the taxing authorities shall at any time during the term of this Lease assess any of the above-described property against the real estate, the Tenant shall repay the taxes thus assessed to Landlord and paid by Landlord no later than ten (10) business days after receipt of notice of payment by Landlord.



5.04           Insurance:     Tenant shall pay its Proportionate Share of the cost of all insurance procured by Landlord pursuant to Section 18 hereof.  Tenant shall pay said amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of such cost, which statement shall set forth the basis for such charge.

5.05           Procedures of Paying Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Operating Expenses:

(a)           Books and Records:                                Landlord shall maintain its books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, showing in reasonable detail all of the Common Area Operating Costs, Real Estate Taxes and Insurance Costs.  Tenant shall be entitled, by appointment with Landlord and at Landlord’s headquarters, to review or audit these records during normal business hours for a period of one (1) year after a Lease Year.  If Tenant elects to audit such books and records, Landlord shall reasonably cooperate with Tenant and any deficiency or overpayment disclosed by such audit shall be promptly paid or refunded as the case may be.

(b)           Payment of Additional Rent:                                                      Prior to the beginning of each Lease Year, Landlord shall compute and deliver to Tenant a bonafide estimate of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Operating Costs due hereunder for the appropriate Lease Year, and without further notice Tenant shall pay to Landlord in monthly installments one-twelfth of such estimate simultaneously with Tenant’s payments of Minimum Base Rent during such Lease Year.

(c)           Statement of Tax Payments and Expenses:                                                                           Annually, Landlord shall prepare and shall have certified by an officer or an agent of Landlord (i) a “Statement of Common Area Operating Costs”; (ii) a “Statement of Real Estate Taxes”; and (iii) a “Statement of Insurance Costs” showing, in reasonable detail, all Common Area Operating Costs, the Real Estate Taxes and Insurance Costs for the immediately preceding Lease Year.  The statements shall be prepared and certified within ninety (90) days following the end of the immediately preceding Lease Year.  Landlord shall promptly deliver a copy thereof to Tenant.

(d)           Annual Statements:                                Within ninety (90) days following the end of each Lease Year together with the information to be provided in connection with Sections 5.05(b) and 5.05(c) above, Landlord shall prepare and deliver to Tenant (i) a “Notice of Additional Rent Due-Common Area Operating Costs”; (ii) a “Notice of Additional Rent Due-Real Estate Taxes”; and (iii) a “Notice of Additional Rent Due-Insurance Costs”, certified to be correct by an officer of Landlord, advising Tenant of the amounts, if any, due Landlord as additional rent or the amount



1. `SECURITY DEPOSIT`

23610.4-725260 v3, jdl 4-18-12

6.01           Deposit:     Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of Twenty Five Thousand &               No/100------------Dollars ($25,000.00) as security for the performance by Tenant of all of the terms, covenants and conditions required to be performed by it hereunder.  Such sum shall be returned to Tenant after the expiration of the term of this Lease and delivery of possession of the Premises to Landlord if, at such time, Tenant is not in material default of any provision of this Lease.  Prior to the time when Tenant is entitled to the return of the security deposit, Landlord shall be entitled to intermingle such deposit with its own funds and to use such sum for such purposes as Landlord may determine.  Tenant shall not be entitled to any interest on the security deposit.

6.02           Default:     Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under this Lease, Landlord may use, apply, or retain all or any part of the security deposit for the payment of any unpaid Minimum Base Rent or additional rent, or for any other amount which Landlord may be required to expend by reason of the default of Tenant, including any damages or deficiency in the reletting of the Premises, regardless of whether the accrual of such damages or deficiency occurs before or after an eviction.  If a portion of the Deposit is so used or applied, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of such use or application, and Tenant shall, upon fifteen (15) business day’s written demand, deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient to restore the Deposit to its original amount.  Tenant’s failure to do so shall constitute a default under this Lease.

6.03           Sale of Building:     In the event of an assignment of Landlord’s interest in the Premises, Landlord shall transfer the Deposit to the assignee thereof and Landlord shall thereupon be released from all liability for the return of the Deposit; provided that such assignee assumes Landlord’s obligation with respect to the Deposit under this Lease.  Neither Landlord nor Tenant shall encumber the money                                                      deposited as security.

1. `CONSTRUCTION`

7.01           Shell Improvements:                                           Landlord shall cause the shell improvements described in Exhibit “B” attached hereto (the “Shell Improvements”) to be completed in accordance with the plans and specifications (the “Shell Plans”) prepared by Landlord and in accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and requirements (the “Applicable Laws”), including, without limitation, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and all regulations issued thereunder and Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities issued pursuant thereto, as amended (collectively, the “ADA”).
