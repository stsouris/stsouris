The aforesaid indemnification and defenses shall survive the term of this Lease. Tenant shall comply with all Rules and Regulations, with respect to the Total Property. A copy of the Rules and Regulations is attached hereto as Exhibit C. The Rules and Regulations may be altered or amended by Landlord from time to time.

3. **TERM.** Landlord shall deliver possession of the Premises in the condition required under Section 1 to the Tenant, which shall occur after this lease has been fully executed by both parties, and the lease has been delivered to both parties. The term of this Lease shall be ten (10) years and four (4) months, commencing on the date that Landlord delivers the space per this Section 3.

4. **RENT.** Tenant shall pay the following Base Rent and Additional Rent (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Rent”) during the term of this Lease, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month, or as otherwise set forth in this Lease, without setoff or deduction, at the office of Landlord. Payment of the first month’s rent due hereunder shall be paid at the time of the execution of this Lease by Tenant. In the event any Rent is due for a partial calendar month or year, the Rent shall be equitably adjusted to reflect that portion of the lease term within such month or year. All accrued Rent shall survive the Lease term.

(a) **Base.** Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Base Rent in the first lease year (each such lease year, a “Lease Year”) which shall be, the sum of Seventy-Three Thousand Fifty-Nine and 31/100 Dollars ($73,059.31), per year, payable in equal monthly installments of Six Thousand Eighty-Eight and 28/100 Dollars ($6,088.28) each. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be required to pay Base Rent for the first four (4) months of the Lease term. The aforegoing Base Rent for the first Lease Year is calculated based upon the total aggregate cost of Landlord’s Tenant Improvements being One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) (the “Landlord’s Tenant Improvements Cost Base Amount”). Said Tenant Improvements Costs Base Amount shall be fully amortized over the 10 years Lease term at an interest rate of eight percent (8%) per annum and is included in the aforementioned Base Rent amount. Each Lease Year shall be comprised of complete twelve (12) month periods. The first and the last Lease Year will include any portion of the first and last calendar month of term, as the case may be, if the commencement of the term shall be on other than the first day of a calendar year. This Base Rent shall increase by two and one-half percent (2.5%) compounded on each anniversary date of the commencement of the Lease.

(b) **Additional.** Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Tenant’s pro rata share of the CAM expenses (as such term is hereinafter defined) incurred by Landlord for and on behalf of the Total Property; and, in addition thereto, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Tenant’s pro rata share of any Taxes and Insurance (as such terms are hereinafter defined) payable by Landlord in the then Total Property’s fiscal year. These charges shall be estimated by Landlord, paid monthly by Tenant, and reconciled in March of each succeeding year.

(i) **Taxes**. Taxes shall include, without limitation, any tax, assessment, or governmental charge (herein collectively referred to as “Taxes”) imposed against the Total Property, or against any of Landlord’s personal property located therein. Taxes, as herein defined, are predicated upon the present system of taxation in the state of [Maryland](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.lawinsider.com/contracts/tagged/maryland-us). Therefore, if due to a future change in the method of taxation any rent, franchise, use, profit or other tax shall be levied against Landlord in lieu of any Tax which would otherwise constitute a “real estate tax”, such rent, franchise, use, profit or other tax shall be deemed to be a Tax for the purposes herein. In the event Landlord is assessed with a Tax which Landlord, in its sole discretion, deems excessive, Landlord may challenge said Tax or may defer compliance therewith to the extent legally permitted; and, in such an event, Tenant shall be liable for Tenant’s pro rata share of all reasonable costs in connection with such challenge.

(ii) Insurance. Insurance shall include, without limitation, premiums for liability, property damage, fire, workers compensation, rent and any and all other insurance (herein collectively referred to as “Insurance”) which Landlord deems necessary to carry on, for, or in connection with Landlord’s operation of the Total Property, including Insurance to be carried by Landlord pursuant to the provisions of Section 19 hereof. In addition thereto, in the event Tenant’s use of the Premises shall result in an increase of any of Landlord’s Insurance premiums, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, upon demand, as Additional Rent, an amount equal to such increase in Insurance. Such payments of Insurance premiums shall be in addition to all premiums of insurance which Tenant is required to carry pursuant to Section 19 of this Lease.

(iii) Common Area Maintenance. Common area maintenance charges (hereinafter referred to as “CAM” expenses) shall include by way of example but not as a limitation, without limitation: the maintenance, repair and replacement, if necessary, of the downspouts, gutters, access roads, driveways, sidewalks and passageways; trunk-line plumbing (as opposed to branch-line plumbing); common utilities and exterior lighting; landscaping; snow removal; fire protection; exterior painting; interior painting of the common areas of the Total Property; management fees; asset management fees; and all other expenses incurred by Landlord for or on behalf of the Total Property. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in no event shall CAM expenses include any expense chargeable to a capital account or capital improvement under generally accepted accounting principles as currently employed by Landlord, except for capital expenditures necessary to comply with government regulations or law or capital expenditures which will reasonably reduce operating costs, and except that CAM expenses may include the amortization or depreciation of capital improvements (other than the existing building improvements) or equipment utilized in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Total Property over the useful lives of such capital improvements and equipment; nor shall CAM expenses include any cost associated with leasing, including but not limited to brokerage fees, advertising and tenant improvements.

In addition to the aforesaid, Landlord reserves the right to perform any or all of the repairs and maintenance covenanted to be performed by Tenant pursuant to Section 8, below; and, in such event, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, Landlord’s reasonable costs of such repairs and maintenance.

(iv) **Payment of Additional Rent.** Landlord shall invoice Tenant monthly or otherwise from time to time, for Tenant’s pro rata share of the Taxes, Insurance and CAM expenses, as reasonably estimated by Landlord; and Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, those amounts for which Tenant is invoiced within thirty (30) days after receipt of said invoice. Any monies paid in advance to Landlord by Tenant shall not accrue interest thereon. At the end of each calendar year or property fiscal year, Landlord shall deliver a statement to Tenant setting forth the difference between Tenant’s actual pro rata share of Taxes, Insurance and/or CAM expenses and the total amount of monthly payments paid by Tenant to Landlord. Tenant shall thereafter pay to Landlord the full amount of any difference between Tenant’s actual obligation over the total amount of Tenant’s estimated payments within thirty (30) days after receipt of said statement; conversely, in the event Tenant’s estimated payments exceed Tenant’s actual obligation, Landlord shall refund the overpayment to Tenant or credit the amount to the next installments of CAM due. For purposes of this Lease, Tenant’s pro rata share is hereinafter defined as a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the square footage of the Premises, and the denominator of which shall be the square footage of the Total Property, which pro rata share is hereby agreed to be equal to fifty percent (50%). In the event this Lease expires on a date other than the end of a billing period, Tenant’s obligation with respect to any amounts owed to Landlord shall survive the expiration of the lease term, and shall be invoiced to Tenant when the same have been accurately determined or, at Landlord’s option, such amounts shall be reasonably estimated by Landlord to reflect the period of time the Lease was in effect during such billing period.

Landlord shall maintain complete and accurate records of all Taxes, Insurance and CAM expenses incurred in connection with the Total Property. Tenant shall have the right to inspect such records at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, at the office of Landlord’s managing agent during said agent’s normal business hours, upon ten (10) days prior written notice once a calendar year.

5. **LATE CHARGE.** In the event Tenant is late by more than ten (10) business days in the payment of any Rent, additional rent, or other charge due Landlord, Tenant shall pay a late charge for Landlord’s increased administrative expenses, which late charge shall be payable as Additional Rent, and shall be equal to five percent (5%) of all outstanding amounts owed Landlord if not paid within the foregoing ten (10) day period, and one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) per month each month on all amounts overdue for more than ten (10) days.

6. **UTILITIES.** Landlord agrees to supply water, gas, electricity and, sewer and connections to the building; but Tenant shall pay for the use of all such gas, electricity, water, sewer and telephone services, and any other utilities and/or services used by Tenant within and/or serving the Premises, together with any taxes, penalties, surcharges or the like pertaining thereto. Tenant shall be liable for all maintenance and equipment with respect to the continued operation of such utilities including, without limitation, all electric light bulbs, tubes and starters. In the event any such utilities are not separately metered, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a portion of the cost of such utilities determined by Landlord’s independent engineer or manager. In no event shall Landlord be liable for any interruption or failure of any utility servicing the Total Property.

7. **LANDLORD’S REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.** Landlord, at Landlord’s sole cost and expense, shall maintain, repair and replace, if necessary, the structural portions of the roof, foundation and the exterior walls. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in the event any such maintenance or repairs are caused by the negligence of Tenant or Tenant’s employees, agents or invitees, Tenant shall reimburse to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the cost of all such maintenance and repairs within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord’s invoice for same. For purposes of this Section, the term “exterior walls” shall not include windows, plate glass, window and door frames, outside lighting, office doors, dock doors, dock bumpers, office entries or any exterior improvement made by Tenant. Landlord reserves the right to designate all sources of services in connection with Landlord’s obligations under this Lease. As also provided in Section 11 hereof, Tenant hereby grants to Landlord the right to enter upon the Premises, at reasonable times, and upon reasonable notice, except in emergencies exclusively determined by Landlord, for the purpose of making inspections and/or repairs and in order to carry out or enforce any provision of this Lease. Tenant shall have the duty to periodically inspect the Premises and notify Landlord should Tenant observe a need for repairs or maintenance of any obligation required to be performed by Landlord under this Lease. Upon receipt of Tenant’s notice, Landlord shall have a reasonable period of time to make such repairs or maintenance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord fails to perform an obligation of Landlord within a reasonable time, Tenant shall have the right to perform such obligation on behalf and at the expense of Landlord, the cost of which performance by Tenant, together with interest thereon at the rate of 18% annually from the date of such expenditure, shall be payable by Landlord to Tenant, upon demand.

Furthermore, in the event any essential services directly supplied by Landlord to or for the Premises are interrupted, Tenant shall be entitled to an abatement of Base Rent and Additional Rent beginning on the tenth consecutive business day, after tenant has notified Landlord in writing of such interruption. The abatement shall end when the services are restored. Tenant shall have the option to terminate this Lease if the interruption unreasonably interferes with Tenant’s use of or access to the Premises for at least sixty (60) consecutive days after tenant has notified Landlord in writing of such interruption.

Landlord shall not be liable for, and Landlord is hereby released and relieved from, all claims and demands of any kind by reason of or resulting from damage or injury to any person or property of Tenant or any other party, directly or indirectly caused by (i) dampness, water, rain or snow, in any part of the Leased Premises or in any part of any other property of Landlord or of others, and/or (ii) falling plaster, steam, gas, electricity, or any leak or break in any part of the Leased Premises or from any pipes, appliances or plumbing or from sewers or the street or subsurface or from any other place or any part of any other property of Landlord or of others or in the pipes of the plumbing or heating facilities thereof, no matter how caused.

8. **TENANT’S REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.** Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, shall have the affirmative duty to periodically inspect, maintain, service, repair and replace, if necessary, all portions of the Premises which are not expressly the responsibility of Landlord including, but not limited to, any windows, plate glass, office doors, dock doors, office entries, interior walls and finish work, floors and floor coverings, water heaters, electrical fixtures, sprinkler systems, dock bumpers, plumbing, fixtures and pest extermination.

The service contract must include all services suggested by the equipment manufacturer in its operations/maintenance manual and an executed copy of such contract must be provided to Landlord prior to the date Tenant takes possession of the Premises. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in the event that Tenant fails to properly secure such service contract within thirty (30) days of written notice from Landlord, Landlord shall have the option to enter into a regularly scheduled preventative maintenance/service contract on items for and on behalf of Tenant. Each such contract shall include, without limitation, all services suggested or recommended by the equipment manufacturer in the operation and maintenance of such system.

9. **ALTERATIONS**. Tenant shall not make any alterations, additions or improvements to the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord, such consent with respect to non-structural interior alterations not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, may install trade fixtures as Tenant may deem necessary, so long as such trade fixtures do not penetrate or disturb the structural integrity and support provided by the roof, exterior walls or subfloors or require excavation of the floor slab or disturbance of column supports. All such trade fixtures, as well as any other alterations, additions or improvements made by Tenant with the aforesaid approval of Landlord, shall be constructed and/or installed by contractors approved by Landlord, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, in a good and workmanlike manner, and in compliance with all applicable governmental and quasi-governmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as all requirements of Landlord’s insurance carrier. If applicable, a list of Landlord’s pre-approved Tenant alterations, approved subject to review of Tenant drawings and compliance with the preceding provisions of this Section 9, is set forth on **Exhibit E**.

Other than the initial improvements to be made by Tenant incidental to Tenant’s initial occupancy of the Premises (hereby shown in Exhibit E and for purposes of this paragraph the “Tenant’s Initial Alterations”), then it is agreed that, subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall at Tenant’s sole expense remove all alterations, additions or improvements installed by Tenant within the Premises, including any materials other than paint which are applied to the columns, decking or joists, properly fill all holes in the floor and remove all above the floor improvements installed by Tenant, and upon such removal, Tenant shall at Tenant’s sole expense restore the Premises to a condition substantially similar to that condition when received by Tenant. However, notwithstanding the aforesaid, (i) upon Landlord’s written election, all or a portion of such alterations, additions and improvements shall revert to Landlord and shall remain within the Premises, and (ii) in the event that with respect to any alterations, additions and/or improvements other than the Tenant’s Initial Alterations, Tenant desires that said alterations, additions and/or improvements remain on the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, at the time Tenant submits its request for Landlord’s consent to such alterations, additions and/or improvements, Tenant shall list those items which Tenant desires to remain on the Premises at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, and Landlord shall within fifteen (15) days subsequent to the date of such request, notify Tenant whether it has agreed that such items shall remain on the Premises at the time of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, and to the extent Landlord shall at that time not agree that such items shall remain on the Premises at the time of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding clause (i), at the time of the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove all such alterations, additions and/or improvements in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sentence.

10. **DESTRUCTION.** If the Premises or the Total Property are damaged in whole or in part by casualty so as to render the Premises unusable for their intended purpose, and if the damages cannot be repaired within one hundred fifty (150) days from the date of said casualty, this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such casualty. If the damages can be repaired within said one hundred fifty (150) days, and Landlord does not elect within forty-five (45) days after the date of such casualty to repair the same, then either party may terminate this Lease by written notice served upon the other. In the event of any such termination, the parties shall have no further obligations to the other, except for those obligations accrued through the effective date of such casualty; and, upon such termination, Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord. Should Landlord elect to make such repairs, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, and Landlord shall proceed with all due diligence to repair and restore the Premises to a condition substantially similar to that condition which existed prior to such casualty. In the event the repair and restoration of the Premises extends beyond one hundred fifty (150) days after the date of such casualty due to causes beyond the control of Landlord, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, and Landlord shall not be liable therefor; but Landlord shall continue to complete such repairs and restoration with all due diligence. Tenant shall not be required to pay any Rent for any period in which the Premises are completely unusable for its intended purpose. In the event only a portion of the Premises are unusable for their intended purpose, Tenant’s Rent shall be equitably abated in proportion to that portion of the Premises which is so unfit. However, there shall be no Rent abatement if said damage is due to the fault or negligence of Tenant or Tenant’s agents, employees or invitees.

11. **INSPECTION.** Landlord shall have the right to enter and inspect the Premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of the Premises, or in order to make such repairs as may be required or permitted to be made by Landlord under the terms of this Lease. In addition thereto, during the last twelve (12) months of the lease term, Landlord shall have the right to enter the Premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of showing the Premises to prospective third-party tenants provided, however, that Landlord shall give Tenant at least three (3) days advance notice, and Tenant or a representative of Tenant shall have the right to be present during any such exhibition by Landlord; and, during said twelve (12) months, Landlord shall have the right to erect on the Premises and the Total Property a suitable sign indicating that the Premises are available for lease.

Tenant shall give Landlord thirty (30) days written notice prior to Tenant vacating the Premises for the purpose of arranging a joint inspection of the Premises with respect to any obligation to be performed therein by Tenant including, without limitation, the necessity of any repair or restoration of the Premises

12. **SIGNS.** Tenant shall not place or permit any signs, lights, awnings or poles in or about the Premises or the Total Property, other than the standard building signage as per landlord specifications, without the prior written consent of Landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; nor shall Tenant change the uniform architecture, paint, landscape, or otherwise alter or modify the exterior of the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord. Landlord will cooperate with Tenant’s signage requests, both temporary and permanent, subject to approvals of CA and HRD, if applicable, and the Xxxxxx County government. All signs shall be at Tenant’s sole costs and expense and shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

13. **SUBLETTING AND ASSIGNING.** Tenant shall not sublet the Premises or any portion thereof, nor allow the same to be used or occupied by any other person or for any other use than herein specified, without the prior written consent of Landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed in the case of a sublet of less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total square footage of the total space in the Premises. However, all such subtenants shall have credit at least equal to Tenant’s at the time this Lease is executed and engage in a use not objectionable to Landlord in its reasonable discretion. Any other assignment or sublease shall be subject to Landlord’s sole and absolute and absolute subjective discretion. For purposes of this Section, the transfer of any majority interest in any corporation or partnership or a substantial portion of the assets of any entity, which controls Tenant, including any transfer by operation of law, shall be deemed to be an assignment of this Lease. In the event Landlord consents to any assignment or sublease, the same shall not constitute a release of Tenant from the full performance of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease. In the event of any sublease or assignment, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all reasonable attorneys’ fees in connection with reviewing and/or drafting any appropriate documents to effect such an assignment of Tenant’s interests or a sublease hereunder. Notwithstanding any term or provision herein to the contrary, Tenant shall be permitted, without the consent of Landlord, to assign or sublet Tenant’s right, title and interest under this Lease to a subsidiary or affiliate of Tenant. In the event of such a sublet or assignment, Tenant shall remain liable for all of terms, rights, and obligations set forth herein.

(b) In the event of default as defined in Subsection 14(a) hereof, Landlord, in addition to any and all legal and equitable remedies it may have, shall have the following remedies:

(i) To distrain for any rent or additional rent in default; and

15. **HOLDOVER.** Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall surrender the Premises to Landlord, without demand, in the condition required under the last paragraph of Section 8. If Tenant shall remain in possession of the Premises after the termination of this Lease, and hold over for any reason, Tenant shall be deemed guilty of unlawful detainer; or, at Landlord’s election, Tenant shall be deemed a holdover tenant and, after the initial month of the holdover period, shall pay to Landlord monthly Rent equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the total Rent payable hereunder during the last month prior to any such holdover, as well as any other damages incurred by Landlord as a result of such holdover. Should any of Tenant’s property remain within the Premises after the termination of this Lease, it shall be deemed abandoned, and Landlord shall have the right to store or dispose of it at Tenant’s cost and expense.

16. **RIGHT TO CURE TENANT’S DEFAULT.** In the event Tenant is in default under any provision of this Lease, other than for the payment of Rent, and such Default is not cured by Tenant within ten (10) business days after receipt of Landlord’s written notice, Landlord may cure such Default on behalf of Tenant, at Tenant’s expense. Landlord may also perform any obligation of Tenant, without notice to Tenant, should Landlord deem such performance to be an emergency. Any monies expended by Landlord to cure any such Default(s), or resolve any deemed emergency shall be payable by Tenant as Additional Rent. If Landlord incurs any expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in prosecuting and/or defending any action or proceeding by reason of any emergency or default, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for same, as Additional Rent, with interest thereon at eighteen percent (18%) annually from the date such payment is due Landlord

17. HOLD HARMLESS. Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any damages to the Premises or the Total Property, nor for any damages to Tenant on or about the Total Property, nor for any other damages arising from the action or negligence of Tenant, co-tenants or other occupants of the Total Property; and Tenant hereby releases, discharges and shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Landlord, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, from all losses, claims, liability, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) due to any damage or injury to persons or property of the parties hereto or of third persons, caused by Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, Tenant’s breach or default of any covenant under this Lease, or Tenant’s use of any equipment, facilities or property in, on, or adjacent to the Total Property. Furthermore, Tenant shall at all times remain liable for, and indemnify and hold harmless Landlord as aforesaid against, any damage or injury arising from perils against which Tenant is required by this Lease to insure, regardless of the negligence or willful act or omissions of others. In the event any suit shall be instituted against Landlord by any third person for which Tenant is hereby indemnifying and holding Landlord harmless, Tenant shall defend such suit at Tenant’s sole cost and expense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; or, in Landlord’s discretion, Landlord may elect to defend such suit, in which event Tenant shall pay Landlord, as Additional Rent, Landlord’s costs of such defense.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Landlord shall indemnify, hold harmless and (at Tenant’s option) defend Tenant, its agents, servants and employees from and against all claims, actions, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ and other professional fees), judgments, settlement payments, and, whether or not reduced to final judgment, all liabilities, damages, or fines paid, incurred or suffered by any third parties to the extent arising directly or indirectly from (a) any default by Landlord under the terms of this Lease, (b) the use or occupancy of the Property by Landlord or any person claiming through or under Landlord, and/or (c) any acts or omissions of Landlord or any contractor, agent employee, invitee or licensee of Landlord in or about the Property. The foregoing indemnity is in addition to, and not in substitution for any indemnity given by Landlord to Tenant under Section 2.

19. **INSURANCE.** Landlord shall maintain in full force and effect policies of insurance covering the Total Property in an amount not less than eighty percent (80%) of the Total Property’s “replacement cost”, as such term is defined in the Replacement Cost Endorsement attached to such policy, insuring against physical loss or damage generally included in the classification of “all risk” coverage. Such insurance shall be for the sole benefit of Landlord, and under Landlord’s sole control.

Tenant shall maintain in full force and effect throughout the term of this Lease policies providing “all risk” insurance coverage protecting against physical damage (including, but not limited to, fire, lightning, extended coverage perils, vandalism, sprinkler leakage, water damage, collapse, and other special extended perils) to the extent of 100% of the replacement cost of Tenant’s property and improvements, as well as broad form comprehensive or commercial general liability insurance, in an occurrence form, insuring Landlord and Tenant jointly against any liability (including bodily injury, property damage and contractual liability) arising out of Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, with a combined single limit of not less than $2,000,0000 or a greater amount as may be reasonably required by Landlord from time to time. All such policies shall be of a form and content satisfactory to Landlord; and Landlord, its property manager and any mortgagee shall be named as an additional insured on all such policies. All policies shall be with companies licensed to do business in the State of [Maryland](https://12ft.io/proxy?ref=&q=https://www.lawinsider.com/contracts/tagged/maryland-us), and rated A+:XV in the most current issue of Best’s Key Rating Guide. Tenant shall furnish Landlord with certificates of all policies at least ten (10) days prior to occupancy; and, further, such policies shall provide that not less than thirty (30) days written notice be given to Landlord before any such policies are canceled or substantially changed to reduce the insurance provided thereby. All such policies shall be primary and noncontributing with or in excess of any insurance carried by Landlord. Tenant shall not do any act which may make void or voidable any insurance on the Premises or the Total Property; and, in the event Tenant’s use of the Premises shall result in an increase in Landlord’s insurance premiums, Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand, as Additional Rent, an amount equal to such increase in insurance.

20. **MORTGAGES.** This Lease is subject and subordinated to any mortgages, deeds of trust or underlying leases, as well as to any extensions or modifications thereof (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Mortgages”), now of record or hereafter placed of record. In the event Landlord exercises its option to further subordinate this Lease, Tenant shall at the option of the holder of said Mortgage attorn to said holder. Any subordination shall be self-executing, but Tenant shall, at the written request of Landlord, execute such further assurances as Landlord deems desirable to confirm such subordination. In the event Tenant should fail or refuse to execute any instrument required under this Section, within ten (10) days after Landlord’s request, Landlord shall be granted a limited power of attorney to execute such instrument in the name of Tenant. In the event any existing or future lender holding a mortgage, deed of trust or other commercial paper requires a modification of this Lease which does not increase Tenant’s Rent hereunder, or does not materially change any obligation of Tenant hereunder, Tenant agrees to execute appropriate instruments to reflect such modification, upon request by Landlord.

22. **GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.** Landlord warrants that, to its actual knowledge, without any duty to investigate, the Premises were in compliance with all government regulations, building codes and laws at the time they were constructed. Tenant, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, shall conform with all laws and requirements of any Municipal, State or Federal authorities now in force, or which may hereafter be in force, pertaining, to or in connection with, Tenant’s occupancy of the Premises, including all requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 (as may be amended). In addition, Tenant shall conform with any reasonable requirement of Landlord’s insurance carrier with respect to Tenant’s use of the Premises. The judgment of any court or an admission of Tenant in any action or proceeding at law, whether Landlord be a party thereto or not, shall be conclusive of the fact as between Landlord and Tenant.


25. **OWNERSHIP.** Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, the term “Landlord” as used in this Lease, shall be defined as the then current owner(s) of the Total Property. In the event of any transfer of the Total Property, whereby this lease is assigned to the transferee incidental to such a transfer of the total property, the party the party conveying same shall thereafter be automatically released from all liability with respect to any obligations thereafter occurring or covenants thereafter to be performed by Landlord but only to the extent such obligations or covenants are properly assigned or otherwise conveyed. It is expressly understood and agreed that none of the covenants of Landlord under this Lease are personal in nature, and that Tenant agrees to look solely to the Total Property for recovery of any damages for breach or non-performance of any of the obligations of Landlord hereunder.

26. **SECURITY DEPOSIT.** Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of Six Thousand Eighty-Eight and 28/100 Dollars ($6,088.28) as security for the full and faithful performance of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease. Tenant acknowledges that such security deposit shall be placed in Landlord’s general operating account, with any interest accruing thereon payable to Landlord. Such security deposit shall not be construed as an advance Rent payment or as a measure of Landlord’s damages in the event of a Default by Tenant. If Tenant should be placed in default with respect to any provision of this Lease, Landlord may apply all or a portion of said security deposit for the payment of any sum in Default or for the payment of any amount which Landlord expends by reason of such Default. If any portion of said deposit is so applied, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord, within ten (10) days after receipt of Landlord’s written demand, an amount sufficient to restore said security deposit to its original amount. Upon the expiration of this Lease, Landlord shall return said security deposit to Tenant, provided Tenant has paid to Landlord all sums owing to Landlord under this Lease, and Tenant has returned the Premises to Landlord in compliance with the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 8 hereof. The security deposit and, as also required in Section 4, the first month’s rent are due and payable upon Lease execution by Tenant.

27. **ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES.** Each of Landlord and Tenant shall execute and return to the requesting party, within ten (10) business days, a statement in writing certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect, that the non-requesting party has no defenses, offsets or counterclaims against its obligations to pay any Rent or to perform any other covenants under this Lease, that there are no uncured Defaults of Landlord or Tenant, and setting forth the dates to which the Rent and other charges have been paid, and any other information reasonably requested by the requesting party. In the event the non-requesting party fails to return such statement within said ten (10) business days period setting forth the above or, alternatively, setting forth those lease modifications, defenses and/or uncured Defaults, the non-requesting party shall be in Default hereunder or, at the requesting party's election, it shall be deemed that the requesting party's statement is correct with respect to the information therein contained. Any such statement delivered pursuant to this Section may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser, mortgagee or assignee of any mortgagee of the Total Property.


28. **PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES.** Tenant shall timely pay all taxes assessed against Tenant’s personal property and all improvements to the Premises which are in excess of Landlord’s standard installations. If Tenant’s personal property and improvements are assessed with the property of Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to Tenant’s share of such taxes, within ten (10) business days after receipt of Landlord’s statement for same.


33. **NOTICES TO MORTGAGEE.** Tenant agrees that a copy of any notice of default from Tenant to Landlord shall also be sent to the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust on the Premises; provided Tenant has been given written notice of the fact that such mortgage or deed of trust has been made and the address to which such notices shall be sent; and Tenant shall allow said mortgagee or holder of the deed of trust a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty (60) days from the receipt of said notice, to cure, or cause to be cured, any such default. If such default cannot reasonably be cured within the time specified herein, then such additional time as may be necessary shall be allowed, provided the curing of such default is commenced and diligently pursued (including, but not limited to, commencement of foreclosure proceedings if necessary to effect such cure), in which event this Lease shall not be terminated while such remedies are being thus diligently pursued.

34. **NON-WAIVER OF FUTURE ENFORCEMENT.** The receipt of rent or any part thereof by Landlord, with knowledge of any breach of this Lease by Tenant or of any default on the part of Tenant in the observance or performance of any of the conditions or covenants of this Lease, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any provisions of this Lease. No failure on the part of Landlord or of Tenant to enforce any covenant or provision herein contained nor any waiver of any right hereunder by Landlord or Tenant, shall discharge or invalidate such covenant or provision or affect the right of Landlord or Tenant to enforce the same in the event of any subsequent default. The receipt by Landlord of any rent or any sum of money or any other consideration hereunder paid by Tenant after the termination, in any manner, of the Term herein demised, or after the giving by Landlord of any notice hereunder to effect such termination, shall not reinstate, continue or extend the Term herein demised, or destroy or in any manner impair the efficacy of any such notice of termination as may have been given hereunder by Landlord to Tenant prior to the receipt of any such sum of money or other consideration, unless so agreed to in writing and signed by Landlord. Neither acceptance of the keys nor any other act or thing done by Landlord or any agent or employee during the term herein demised shall be deemed to be an acceptance of a surrender of said Leased Premises, excepting only an agreement in writing signed by Landlord accepting or agreeing to accept such surrender
