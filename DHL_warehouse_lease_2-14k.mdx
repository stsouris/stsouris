                                                 For example:
                                                 (a) if such Interruption of Landlord’s Service continues for one (1) minute, one (1) day’s

                                                 four (24) hours and one minute (and for each period of twenty-four (24) hours thereafter
                                                 during which such Interruption of Landlord’s Service continues – whether such Interruption
                                                 of Landlord’s Service is continuous, or whether there are brief periods of service followed
                                                 by further interruptions related to the same initial root cause (i.e., a specific PDU has
                                                 become inoperable, or a specific CRAC unit has become inoperable) [all such subsequent

                                                 four (24) hour period of the Same Interruption.

                                                 The maximum Rent abatement for any twenty-four (24) hour period during which an
                                                 Interruption of Landlord’s Service occurs, regardless of the number or length of
                                                 Interruption of Landlord’s Service stemming from the Same Interruption in such twenty-

                                                 The foregoing notwithstanding, Interruption of Landlord’s Service that are not the “Same
                                                 Interruption” shall entitle Tenant to the abatement rights described above with regard to
                                                 each Independent Interruption (defined below).

                                                 For example: if (aa) a specific PDU becomes inoperable due to an internal electrical
                                                 malfunction, causing some or all of Tenant’s operations to lose power, and (bb) a specific
                                                 CRAC unit becomes inoperable due to a lack of the necessary cooling agent, causing a rise
                                                 in the temperature of the Premises above that which is described in Item 4(a) of Exhibit
                                                 “F”, such that Tenant cuts power to its operating equipment in order to protect such
                                                 equipment from the effects of high temperatures (and such lack of cooling agent is not
                                                 directly caused by the inoperable PDU), then (aa) and (bb) would be considered
                                                 “Independent Interruptions”.

              specifically set forth herein, Landlord shall have no obligation to construct or install any improvements in or to make any other

              duration of such interruption. The cost thereof shall be borne by Tenant if such interruption or failure was caused by any act or
              omission of Tenant or Tenant’s employees, agents, invitees or contractors.

              policy or policies of insurance in accordance with the terms and requirements set forth in Exhibit “B” to this Lease. Tenant
              hereby waives its rights against the Landlord Group (defined in
              Item 24 of the Basic Lease Information) with respect to any claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury
              to persons and/or damage to property) which are caused by or result from (i) risks insured against under any insurance policy
              carried by Tenant at the time of such claim, damage, loss or injury, or (ii) risks which would have been covered under any
              insurance required to be obtained and maintained by Tenant under this Lease had such insurance been obtained and maintained
              as required; provided, however, that in no event shall Tenant be deemed to have waived its right against Landlord with respect
              to any claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury to persons and/or damage to property) which are
              caused by or result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any member of the Landlord Group. The foregoing
              waivers shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, any other waivers or releases contained in this Lease and shall survive
              expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. All of Tenant’s insurance policies shall be endorsed so as to include a waiver of
              subrogation with and to the full extent of Tenant’s waiver of claims above.

              installed therein against loss due to fire and other casualties included in standard extended coverage insurance policies, in an
              amount equal to the replacement cost thereof. Landlord shall also maintain such insurance as is customarily carried by
              reasonably prudent landlords of datacenters in the city in which the Property is located. All insurance required under this Lease
              shall be issued by insurers with a “General Policyholders Rating” of at least A-, VIII, as set forth in “Best’s Insurance Guide.”
              Such insurers shall be authorized to do business in the state in which the Property is located. Landlord hereby waives its rights
              against Tenant with respect to any claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury to persons and/or
              damage to property) which are caused by or result from (i) risks insured against under any insurance policy carried by Landlord
              at the time of such claim, damage, loss or injury, or (ii) risks which would have been covered under any insurance required to
              be obtained and maintained by Landlord under this Lease had such insurance been obtained and maintained as required;
              provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord be deemed to have waived its rights against Tenant with respect to any
              claims or damages or losses (including any claims for bodily injury to persons and/or damage to property) which are caused by
              or result from the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant and/or the Tenant Parties, as defined in Section 14.2 below. The
              foregoing waivers shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, any other waivers or releases contained in this Lease. All of
              Landlord’s insurance policies shall be endorsed so as to include a waiver of subrogation with and to the full extent of
              Landlord’s waiver of claims above.



              15. TENANT DEFAULT.
                  15.1 Events of Default By Tenant. Each of the following acts or omissions of Tenant or occurrences shall constitute an
              “Event of Default”:
                        15.1.1 Any failure or refusal by Tenant to timely pay any Rent or any other payments or charges required to be paid
              hereunder, or any portion thereof, within three (3) days of notice that the same is due.

                         15.1.2 Any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other covenant or condition of this Lease (including, without
              limitation, in the Datacenter Rules and Regulations) to be performed or observed by Tenant (other than those described in
              Section 15.1.1, above or Sections 15.1.3, 15.1.4, or 15.1.5, below) if such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days
              following written notice to Tenant of such failure; provided, however, that in the event Tenant’s failure to perform or observe
              any covenant or condition of this Lease to be performed or observed by Tenant cannot reasonably be cured within thirty
              (30) days following written notice to Tenant, Tenant shall not be in default if Tenant commences to cure same within ten
              (10) days after Tenant’s receipt of written notice thereof and thereafter diligently prosecutes the curing thereof to completion.

                          15.1.3 The filing or execution or occurrence of any one of the following: (i) a petition in bankruptcy or other
              insolvency proceeding by or against Tenant, (ii) a petition or answer seeking relief under any provision of the Bankruptcy Act,
              (iii) an assignment for the benefit of creditors, (iv) a petition or other proceeding by or against Tenant for the appointment of a
              trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant or any of Tenant’s property, or (v) a proceeding by any governmental authority for the
              dissolution or liquidation of Tenant or any other instance whereby Tenant or any general partner of Tenant shall cease doing
              business as a going concern, where such petition, assignment or proceeding is not dismissed within sixty (60) days after filing.

                        15.1.4 Any failure by Tenant to execute and deliver any statement or document described in either Article 11 or
              Section 12.1 requested to be so executed and delivered by Landlord within the time periods specified therein applicable thereto,
              where such failure continues for three (3) days after delivery of written notice of such failure by Landlord to Tenant.

                        The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all of the notice periods provided in this Section 15.1 are in lieu of,
              and not in addition to, the notice requirements of any Applicable Laws.

                   15.2 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord shall have, in addition to any other
              remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the remedies described in Section 1
              of Exhibit “D” attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, each and all of which shall, subject to applicable law,
              be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or demand whatsoever (and all of the other provisions of Section 1 of
              Exhibit “D” shall apply to an Event of Default by Tenant hereunder).



              17. MISCELLANEOUS.


                  17.1 Severability. If any provision of this Lease is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
              unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby.

                   17.2 Performance. The covenants and obligations of Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall be independent of performance
              by Landlord of the covenants and obligations of Landlord pursuant to this Lease. Tenant’s performance of each of its
              obligations under this Lease shall be a condition precedent to the duty of Landlord to perform its obligations hereunder.

                    17.3 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. If either Landlord or Tenant initiates any litigation, mediation, arbitration or other
              proceeding regarding the enforcement, construction or interpretation of this Lease, then the non-prevailing party shall pay the
              prevailing party’s attorneys’ fees and costs (including, without limitation, all expense reimbursements, expert witness fees and
              litigation costs). In addition, if it should otherwise be necessary or proper for Landlord to consult an attorney concerning this
              Lease for the review of instruments evidencing a proposed Transfer, for the purpose of collecting Rent, Tenant agrees to pay to
              Landlord its actual attorneys’ fees whether suit be brought or not to the extent such fees exceed $500.00.

                  17.4 Waiver of Right to Jury Trial. IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE COST OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN
              THE PARTIES, AND AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS LEASE, TO THE
              FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LANDLORD AND TENANT EACH EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO
              TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY TRIAL HELD AS A RESULT OF A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR
              IN ANY MANNER RELATED TO THIS LEASE IN WHICH LANDLORD AND TENANT ARE ADVERSE PARTIES. THE
              FILING OF A CROSS-COMPLAINT BY ONE AGAINST THE OTHER IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE PARTIES
              “ADVERSE.”
