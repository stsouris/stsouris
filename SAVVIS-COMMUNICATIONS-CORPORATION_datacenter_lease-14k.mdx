                                              employees, agents, constituent partners, affiliates, beneficiaries, trustees and
                                              representatives (“Tenant Group”).

                  This Lease shall consist of the foregoing Basic Lease Information, and the provisions of the Standard Lease
              Provisions (the “Standard Lease Provisions”) (consisting of Sections 1 through 17 which follow) and Exhibits
              “A” through “K”, inclusive, all of which are incorporated herein by this reference as of the Effective Date. In the
              event of any conflict between the provisions of the Basic Lease Information and the provisions of the Standard
              Lease Provisions, the Standard Lease Provisions shall control. Any initially capitalized terms used herein and not
              otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Standard Lease Provisions.

           
              2. TERM.
                   2.1 Term. The term of this Lease, and Tenant’s obligation to pay Rent under this Lease, shall commence on the
              Commencement Date and shall continue in effect for the period specified in Item 5 of the Basic Lease Information

              Commencement Date. In the event that Landlord shall fail to deliver to Tenant possession of the Premises on the
              Commencement Date for any other reason, Landlord shall not be deemed in default hereunder, and the
              Commencement Date shall be deemed to be extended until the date on which Landlord shall complete such
              installation and/or tender to Tenant delivery of possession of the Premises; provided, however, that, subject to Force
              Majeure (defined in Section 17.14, below), Tenant shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate
              this Lease if such installation has not been completed and/or Landlord shall fail to tender delivery of possession of
              the Premises on or before the date that is sixty (60) days after the date set forth in Item 4 of the Basic Lease
              Information (as such date may be extended for Force Majeure).

                   2.3 Renewal Options.
                        2.3.1 Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 2.3, Tenant shall have the

              Term of this Lease with respect to the entire Tenant Space, each for an additional term of sixty (60) calendar months
              (collectively the “Renewal Terms”, each a “Renewal Term”), upon the same terms, conditions and provisions
              applicable to the then current Term of this Lease (except as provided otherwise herein). The Base Rent and other
              charges payable with respect to the Tenant Space for each Renewal Term (the “Option Rent”) shall be as follows:
                     1st Renewal Term:

                                              Period:                                              Monthly

                                              181 – 192                                         $414,392.09
                                              193 – 204                                         $426,823.86
                                              205 – 216                                         $439,628.57
                                              217 – 228                                         $452,817.43

                                              Period:                                              Monthly
                                              (months of the Term)                                Base Rent:
                                              241 – 252                                         $480,394.01

                         2.3.2 Tenant may exercise each Renewal Option only by delivering to Landlord a written notice (an
              “Option Exercise Notice”) at least nine (9) calendar months (and not more than twenty-four (24) calendar months)
              prior to then applicable expiration date of the Term, which Option Exercise Notice shall specify that Tenant is
              irrevocably exercising its Renewal Option so as to extend the Term of this Lease by a Renewal Term on the terms
              set forth in this Section 2.3. In the event that Tenant shall duly exercise a Renewal Option, the Term shall be
              extended to include the applicable Renewal Term (and all references to the Term in this Lease shall be deemed to
              refer to the Term specified in Item 5 of the Basic Lease Information, plus all duly exercised Renewal Terms). In the
              event that Tenant shall fail to deliver an Option Exercise Notice within the applicable time period specified herein
              for the delivery thereof, time being of the essence, at the election of Landlord, Tenant shall be deemed to have
              forever waived and relinquished such Renewal Option, and any other options or rights to renew or extend the Term
              effective after the then applicable expiration date of the Term shall terminate and shall be of no further force or
              effect.

                       2.3.3 Tenant shall have the right to exercise any Renewal Option only with respect to the entire Tenant
              Space leased by Tenant at the time that Tenant delivers an Option Exercise Notice. If Tenant duly exercises a
              Renewal Option, Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment reflecting such exercise. Notwithstanding
              anything to the contrary herein, any attempted exercise by Tenant of a Renewal Option shall, be invalid, ineffective,
              and of no force or effect if, on the date on which Tenant delivers an Option Exercise Notice or on the date on which
              the Option Term is scheduled to commence there shall be an uncured Event of Default by Tenant under this Lease.

              3. BASE RENT AND OTHER CHARGES.
                   3.1 Base Rent. Commencing on the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord base rent (the “Base
              Rent”) for the Tenant Space in the amount set forth in Item 9 of the Basic Lease Information. All such Base Rent
              shall be paid to Landlord in monthly installments in advance on the first day of each and every month throughout the
              Term of this Lease; provided, however, that (a) the first full monthly installment of Base Rent shall be payable upon
              Tenant’s execution of this Lease and (b) if the Term of this Lease does not commence on the first day of a calendar
              month, the Base Rent for such partial calendar month shall (i) be calculated on a per diem basis determined by
              dividing the Base Rent above by the number thirty (30) and multiplying such amount by the number of days
              remaining in such calendar month from and after (and including) the Commencement Date, and (ii) shall be paid by
              Tenant to Landlord on the Commencement Date. Tenant shall not pay any installment of Rent (defined in Section
              3.4, below) more than one (1) month in advance.

                   3.2 Intentionally Deleted.

                   3.3 Operating Expenses and Taxes.

                   but including a pro rata share of the salaries and wages of “rotating on-site employees”, such as engineers who
                   rotate among several buildings) engaged in the operation, maintenance and security of the Property, including
                   taxes, insurance and benefits (including pension, retirement and fringe benefits) relating thereto;

                  
                            (ii) Cost of all supplies and materials used in the operation, maintenance and security of the Property
                   (excluding cleaning and char supplies related to the cleaning of other tenants’ premises);
                            (iii) Cost of all electricity supplied to the Common Areas of the Property and all water and sewage

                   cleaning and char contracts related to the cleaning of other tenants’ premises;
                           (v) Cost of all insurance relating to the Property, including the cost of casualty, rental and liability

                   basis, but (A) only if it can be conclusively demonstrated that such item reduced the Operating Expense(s) to
                   which it specifically relates, (B) only to the extent of such demonstrable savings and (C) excluding the cost of
                   any capital improvement arising merely from the breakage or wearing out of a capital item;
                            (viii) Management fee equal to three percent (3%) times the product of gross rents actually collected at
                   the Building during the year at issue (but in no event to exceed the product of the Management Fee Rate Cap
                   (defined below) and the weighted average number of rentable square feet of occupied space in the Building); it
                   being agreed that the management fee shall not be subject to the gross up provision of Section 3.3.4. For the
                   purposes of this Lease, the term “Management Fee Rate Cap” shall mean and refer, in the first year of this
                   Lease, to twenty-four dollars ($24). For each subsequent year of the Lease, the Management Fee Rate Cap shall
                   escalate at a rate of three percent (3%) per year on a cumulative basis (e.g., in the 2nd and 3rd years of the Lease,
                   the Management Fee Rate Cap shall be $24.72 and $25.46, respectively).

                   To the extent that any Operating Expenses are attributable to the Property and other properties of Landlord
              (specifically, including, without limitation, engineers who rotate among buildings), Landlord shall disclose the same
              to Tenant and a fair and reasonable allocation of such Operating Expenses shall be made between the Property and
              such other properties.

                        (2) The term “Operating Expenses” shall exclude the costs set forth on Exhibit “H”.

                        (3) [Intentionally Deleted]

              Term, the actual Operating Expenses for such year. The term “Actual Operating Expenses Rate” shall mean, with
              respect to each calendar year during the Term, the Actual Operating Expenses attributable to each square foot of
              rentable area in the Building (as set forth in

            Item 21 of the Basic Lease Information), and shall be calculated by dividing the Actual Operating Expenses by the
              total number of square feet of rentable area in the Building. The term “Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Actual
              Operating Expenses” shall mean, with respect to each calendar year during the Term, an amount equal to the
              product of (i) the Actual Operating Expenses Rate, multiplied by (ii) the sum of the number of square feet of
              rentable area in the Premises (as defined in Item 7(a) of the Basic Lease Information) in such year.

                        (5) The term “Taxes” shall mean all taxes, assessments and governmental charges (foreseen or unforeseen,
              general or special, ordinary or extraordinary) whether federal, state, county or municipal and whether levied by
              taxing districts or authorities presently taxing the Property or by others subsequently created or otherwise, and any
              other taxes and assessments attributable to the Property or its operation, and all taxes of whatsoever nature that are
              imposed in substitution for or in lieu of any of the taxes, assessments or other charges herein defined (including, but
              not limited to, margin taxes and/or other similar taxes assessed against or imposed on the Property or on Landlord as
              the owner of the Property, or measured by the income or profits of Landlord from the ownership and/or operation of
              the Property, and those taxes described in Section 4.2 hereof). Except as set forth in Article 4 hereof, Taxes shall not
              include any and all federal, state or local (i) franchise, capital stock or similar taxes, if any, of Landlord (unless in
              lieu of or a substitute for any other tax or assessment upon or with respect to any of the Tenant Space which, if such
              other tax or assessment were in effect on the Commencement Date, would be payable by Tenant hereunder or by
              Applicable Law), (ii) income, excess profits or other taxes, if any, of Landlord, determined on the basis of or
              measured wholly or in part by Landlord’s net income (unless such a tax is in the nature of a margin tax or other tax
              on rents, or is levied in lieu of or a substitute for any other tax or assessment upon or with respect to any of the
              Premises, which, if such other tax or assessment were in effect on the Commencement Date, would be payable by
              Tenant hereunder or by Applicable Law), (iii) any estate, inheritance, succession, gift or similar taxes of Landlord,
              (iv) any taxes in connection with the transfer or other disposition of any interest, other than Tenant’s (or any person
              claiming under Tenant), in the Premises or this Lease, to any person or entity, including, but not limited to, any
              capital gains, income, stamp or real property gains or withholding tax (unless attributable to an Event of Default or
              unless such transfer is to Tenant or a person designated by Tenant), or (v) any tax that would not have been imposed
              but for the failure of Landlord to comply with certification, information, documentation or other reporting
              requirements applicable to Landlord, if compliance with such requirements is required by statute or regulation of the
              relevant taxing authority as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, and (vi) any interest or penalties
              relating to any item listed in clauses (i) through (v) above.

              be paid hereunder, or any portion thereof, within five (5) days of notice that the same is due.

                        15.1.2 Any failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other covenant or condition of this Lease
              (including, without limitation, in the Building Rules and Regulations) to be performed or observed by Tenant (other
              than those described in Section 15.1.1, above or Sections 15.1.3, 15.1.4, or 15.1.5, below) if such failure continues
              for a period of thirty (30) days following written notice to Tenant of such failure; provided, however, that in the
              event Tenant’s failure to perform or observe any covenant or condition of this Lease to be performed or observed by
              Tenant cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to Tenant, Tenant shall not be in
              default if Tenant commences to cure same within the thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the
              curing thereof to completion within ninety (90) days following such written notice.

                        15.1.3 The filing or execution or occurrence of any one of the following: (i) a petition in bankruptcy or

              Tenant for the appointment of a trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant or any of Tenant’s property, or (v) a
              proceeding by any governmental authority for the dissolution or liquidation of Tenant or any other instance whereby
              Tenant or any general partner of Tenant shall cease doing business as a going concern.

                  

                       15.1.4 Any failure by Tenant to execute and deliver any statement or document described in either Article
              11 or Section 12.1 requested to be so executed and delivered by Landlord within the time periods specified therein
              applicable thereto, where such failure continues for three (3) days after delivery of written notice of such failure by
              Landlord to Tenant.

                        15.1.5 Intentionally Deleted.

                        The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all of the notice periods provided in this Section 15.1 are in
              lieu of, and not in addition to, the notice requirements of any Applicable Laws.

                  15.2 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord shall have, in addition to any
              other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the remedies
              described in Section 1 of Exhibit “D” attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference, each and all of
              which shall, subject to applicable law, be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or demand whatsoever
              (and all of the other provisions of Section 1 of Exhibit “D” shall apply to an Event of Default by Tenant hereunder).

              16. LIMITATION OF LANDLORD’S LIABILITY.
                   16.1 Landlord Default. In the event that Landlord shall fail to perform any obligation of Landlord to be
              performed under this Lease, Tenant’s sole and exclusive remedies for any such failure shall be an action for money
              damages, specific performance and/or injunctive relief (Tenant hereby waiving the benefit of any laws granting
              Tenant a lien upon the property of Landlord and/or upon rental due Landlord or granting Tenant a right to terminate
              this Lease upon a default by Landlord); provided, however, that Landlord shall not be in default hereunder (and
              Tenant shall have no right to pursue any such claim for damages in connection with any such failure) unless and
              until Tenant shall have delivered to Landlord a written notice specifying such default with particularity, and
              Landlord shall thereafter have failed to cure such default within thirty (30) days (or, if the nature of Landlord’s
              obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are reasonably required for its performance, then not unless
              Landlord shall have failed to commence such performance of such cure within such thirty (30) day period and
              thereafter diligently pursue the same to completion within ninety (90) days). The foregoing notwithstanding,
              Landlord agrees to commence Switch Gear Repairs and Water Repairs within twenty-four (24) hours following
              receipt of written notice from Tenant of the need for same, and shall diligently pursue the curing thereof to
              completion. Unless and until Landlord shall have so failed to so cure any such failure after such notice, Tenant shall
              not have any remedy or cause of action by reason thereof. All obligations of Landlord hereunder will be construed as
              covenants, not conditions.

                   16.2 Landlord’s Liability. In consideration of the benefits accruing under this Lease to Tenant and
              notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease or in any exhibits, riders, amendments, or addenda to this
              Lease (collectively, the “Lease Documents”), it is expressly understood and agreed by and between the parties to
              this Lease that: (i) the recourse of Tenant or its successors or assigns against Landlord (and the liability of Landlord
              to Tenant, its successors and assigns) with respect to (a) any actual or alleged breach or breaches by or on the part of
              Landlord of any representation, warranty, covenant, undertaking or agreement contained in any of the Lease
              Documents, or (b) any matter relating to Tenant’s occupancy of the Tenant Space (collectively, the “Landlord’s
              Lease Undertakings”), shall be limited to no more than an aggregate of Fifteen Million and No/100 Dollars
              ($15,000,000.00) (the “Liability Limit”); (ii) Tenant shall have no recourse against any other assets of the Landlord
              Group (as defined in the Basic Lease Information); (iii) except to the extent of the Liability Limit, no personal
              liability or personal responsibility of any sort with respect to any of Landlord’s Lease Undertakings or any alleged
              breach thereof is assumed by, or shall at any time be asserted or enforceable against, the Landlord Group, and (iv) at
              no time shall Landlord be responsible or liable to Tenant for any lost profits, lost economic opportunities or any
              form of consequential damages as the result of any actual or alleged breach of Landlord of Landlord’s Lease
              Undertakings.


                   16.3 Transfer of Landlord’s Interest. Landlord shall have the right, from time to time, to assign its interest in
              this Lease in whole or, to a wholly owned subsidiary, in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any
              assignment in part to a wholly-owned subsidiary, (i) Landlord shall provide a written notice to Tenant specifying the
              rights and obligations so assigned and (ii) Landlord shall guaranty the performance of the obligations assigned to
              such wholly-owned subsidiary; provided, however, Landlord’s maximum liability under such guaranty shall not
              exceed the maximum liability it would have had under the Lease if such obligations had not been assigned. Landlord
              and each successor to Landlord shall be fully released from the performance of Landlord’s obligations under the
              Lease Documents upon their transfer of Landlord’s interest in the Property to a third party, except for any liabilities
              or obligations of Landlord then existing. Landlord shall not be liable for any obligation under the Lease Documents
              accruing after a transfer of its interest in the Property and Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in interest of
              Landlord in and to this Lease for all obligations and liabilities accruing on or after the date of such transfer. If any
              security has been given by Tenant to secure the faithful performance of any of the covenants of this Lease, Landlord
              shall transfer or deliver said security, as such, to Landlord’s successor in interest and thereupon Landlord shall be
              discharged from any further liability with regard to said security.

              17. MISCELLANEOUS.
                   17.1 Severability. If any provision of this Lease is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
              invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby.

                   17.2 Performance. The covenants and obligations of Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall be independent of
              performance by Landlord of the covenants and obligations of Landlord pursuant to this Lease. Tenant’s performance
              of each of its obligations under this Lease shall be a condition precedent to the duty of Landlord to perform its
              obligations hereunder.

                    17.3 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. If either Landlord or Tenant initiates any litigation, mediation, arbitration or
              other proceeding regarding the enforcement, construction or interpretation of this Lease, then the non-prevailing
              party shall pay the prevailing party’s attorneys’ fees and costs (including, without limitation, all expense
              reimbursements, expert witness fees and litigation costs). In addition, if it should otherwise be necessary or proper
              for Landlord to consult an attorney (in good faith) concerning this Lease (specifically, for the review of instruments
              evidencing a proposed Transfer or for the purpose of collecting delinquent Rent), Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord
              its actual attorneys’ fees whether suit be brought or not to the extent such fees exceed $500.00.

              

                    17.9 Brokers. Each party hereto represents to the other that the representing party has not engaged, dealt with
              or been represented by any broker in connection with this Lease other than the brokers specified in Item 18 of the
              Basic Lease Information. Landlord and Tenant shall each indemnify, defend (with legal counsel reasonably
              acceptable to the other) and hold harmless the other party from and against all Claims (including attorneys’ fees and
              all litigation expenses) related to any claim made by any other person or entity for any commission or other
              compensation in connection with the execution of this Lease or the leasing of the Tenant Space to Tenant (other than
              the Commission Agreement (defined hereinafter)) if based on an allegation that claimant dealt through the
              indemnifying party. The provisions of this Section 17.9 shall survive the termination of this Lease. Landlord shall
              pay Tenant’s Broker a commission of up to One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) pursuant to a separate
              agreement (the “Commission Agreement”) and hereby indemnifies and holds Tenant harmless for all Claims
              (including attorney’s fees and all litigation expenses) arising or relating to Landlord’s failure to pay Tenant’s Broker
              the commission that Tenant’s Broker is due under the Commission Agreement not to exceed $1,000,000.00.
              Additionally, Tenant hereby indemnifies and holds Landlord harmless for all Claims (including attorney’s fees and
              all litigation expenses) arising or relating to any commission that Tenant’s Broker is due in connection with any
              agreement with Tenant, pursuant to which Tenant’s Broker is due a commission, related to this Lease, in excess of an
              aggregate amount of $1,000,000.00.


                  17.10 Examination of Lease. This Lease shall not be binding or effective until each of the parties hereto have
              executed and delivered an original or counterpart hereof to each other.

                  17.11 Recordation. Neither Tenant nor any person or entity acting through, under or on behalf of Tenant shall
              record or cause the recordation of this Lease, a short form memorandum of this Lease or any reference to this Lease.

                    17.12 Authority. The persons executing this Lease on behalf of Landlord and Tenant represent to the other
              party that they are duly authorized to execute and deliver this Lease pursuant to their respective by-laws, operating
              agreement, resolution or other legally sufficient authority. Further, each party and the persons executing this Lease
              on their behalf represent to the other party that (i) if it is a partnership, the undersigned are all of its general partners,
              (ii) it has been validly formed or incorporated, (iii) it is duly qualified to do business in the state in which the
              Property is located, and (iv) this Lease is being executed on its behalf and for its benefit.

                   17.13 Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, all of the covenants, conditions and
              provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
              heirs, personal representatives and permitted successors and assigns.
