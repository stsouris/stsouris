|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New Monthly Rental fee = |  |  | Monthly Rental Fee X New index |  |  |
|  |  |  | Based index |  |  |

whereby

–Monthly Rental Fee = the monthly Rental Fee referred to in Article 4 of the present Agreement;

–base index = the health index of the month preceding the month during which Parties signed present Agreement, namely the index of July 2020 (with 2013 = 100);

–new index = the health index of the month preceding the month of the adjustment of the Rental Fee.

5.3.In the event that the calculation and the publication of the health index should be discontinued or cancelled, the Rental Fee will be linked to the consumer price index. In the event that the calculation and publication of the consumer index should be discontinued-or cancelled, the Rental Fee will be linked to the new index published by the Belgian government which might replace the consumer price index. In the event that no new official index is published and Parties fail to agree on a new method of adjusting the Rental Fee, the method of adjustment will be determined by an expert appointed by the Commercial court ("Tribunal de l'Entreprise"/"Ondememingsrechtbank") of Liege.
